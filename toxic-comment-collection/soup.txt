I am playing this game for a while now but I have never witnessed SO MANY of my friends in battlenet being offline for DAYS and almost always disconnecting in mere hours. 

Personal experience, me and my girlfriend were hardcore WoW players. I can be a cynical bastard at times, I had the thought of getting imprisoned in garrison with no one around to see, doing dailies and spamming a bunch of boring heroics 24/7 were kinda killing my fun for a while... But today when my Blizzard obsessed girlfriend whose barely logged off this game since WOTLK woke up and told me "I am not feeling to play WoW at all today..." and played something else instead...it really made me think that the expansion already ran out of fun. Another hardcore PvP freak friend who wasted nights over this game bought WoD and I couldnt see him online again after that login attempt. And the list goes on with so many "Last login more than a week" guys all over...Out of all my huge friend list I have 3-4 constantly online brave souls SITTING IN THEIR GARRISONS AFK 24/7. No one is there farming transmogs anymore...Hell being in an RP server, even Stormwind Church has less people than ever. 

I have seen others complaning about situation on Trade Chat lately, your average gaming trash's reply to them was "Go play something else". What can I do?! I love WoW. Its the only MMO I can play with huge player database. But I just cant FORCE myself to do inn dailies anymore. I COULDNT EVEN FINISH MY DAILY HERB AND MINING TOURS TODAY! 

By god, what has happened to this game? I have never seen WoW so isolated, boring and out of content before...

By god, what has happened to this game? I have never seen WoW so isolated, boring and out of content before... 

They seemed to remove more than they added in WoD. The little content that IS there is not all that fun at that. 
I like the dungeons and the few bosses I have done in the raid are pretty nice... But the world is just empty and boring, filled with reused models and annoying timesinks. It's a pain in the *** to go anywhere in the world but there is just no reason to so why bother?

-------------------

The old skool guys held some campaigns and Blizz listened. 

That's what happened. 

Now, not really surprisingly, it's as empty, quiet and stuffy as one of those pubs old guys frequent. 

I wouldn't mind so much, but it's not even a classy establishment with a nice restaurant. 

No, it's some backstreet, drab nightmare of a place, with a lingering odour of pork scratchings, full of grumpy mumbling about "kids these days" and "back in my day".

-------------------

yeah i have to say, WOD sucks so far, i wish they'd just take an expansion concept, and go about it the same way they did with WOTLK, instead of adding in all this stupid experimental crap.

-------------------

The problem is, vanilla didn't have any lfr, lfd, quest objectives tracker on map, so many teleports, PvP queue, etc. Returning vanilla play in WoD is like returning medieval social order in modern world. It just doesn't belong there any more. It was fun, big fun. But it's over now. Look at reputation grind in WoD. Most people hated it in vanilla. Most people hate it now.

-------------------

+1 to 2d165465644b525e regarding the fact they seemed to have added less than they taken in WOD but as i also mnetioned WOD is unfinished.

-------------------

Did they even beta test WOD for fun it seems not and also WOD was released unfinished, Tanaan Jungle anyone? 

The ability pruning killed a lot of specs, I feel pigeon holed into playing destruction because it's the most viable in terms of DPS but to be honest all warlock specs are abysmal right now so it doesn't matter if I'm melee'ing bosses, crap DPS is crap DPS. 
Specs has in a way gone back to Vanilla where there is truely ONLY one spec that works and everything else is broken or not fun like Arms warrior 3 button rotation anyone? Rend, MS, whrilwind and whirlwind and whirldwind some more and then OMG MS is back then whirlwind, I'm getting dizzy from just thinking about it. 
The ability pruning hit some classes harder than others and has made some classes completely broken in all 3 specs and it's not fun to completely play the underdog no matter which specialization you choose. 

They completely obliterated all professions and everything is gated behind cooldowns, it's all a ploy to make you sub for longer to do less content because as stated before WOD is an unfinished product. 
Imagine if we had to go out and mine 50 ores to combine to make 1 truesteel ingot, that's 5000 ores to make one craftable but I bet you any money people will still find a way to do that in 2-3 days instead of waiting and waiting and even more waiting for their work orders to complete. 

People who choose to go HAM with thier professions will benefit most like it's always been, you'd go out and farm your mats, long it was, tedious it might have been but rewarding it certainly is. 
Now with a few clicks here and there you now have your very own welfare epic. 

Garrisonville, just makes the game feel so empty and it doesn't immerse you in the world of warcraft it's more like World of Garrisons and with Mafia Wars thrown into it. You log on, do your mining, herbing, work orders and then send your slaves off on missions. This takes 15 minutes tops. 
Then maybe depending on long the missions were you'd log on once every 1 hour, 4 hour and then 8 hour to send your slaves off on missions again. 
If you have a Salvage yard, you'd Salvage for loot and loot all your work orders that are ready. 
Rinse and repeat everyday since level 100 and that was almost 1 month ago. 

Okay, maybe just maybe you'd do a heroic for your inn dailies but honestly who'd want to do those anymore after you've done them to death and are already 635+? 
Play with your friend's you might say? Not even they log on anymore because Garrisonville isn't not entertaining, que song "all by myself" 

Highmaul has just been released and that'll keep the masses at bay for a while but remember after Blackrock foundry nothing 
new is coming out until March and that is being very optimistic! 

TL:DR 

Ability pruning ruined classes. 
WOD released as unfinished product. 
Garrisons make the WoW more un social 
Professions completely Obliterated. 
No incentive to run heroics beyond 635 ilvl.

If u were to listen to a oldschool like me, it would even been Quests just to find a key to enter a damn dungeon, 

It used to be hard before, thats when wow is cool, take away the hard part and things that takes time and u get a baunch of bored players.. things used to be EPIC!!!!!!!!. now u can craft epics for free. if it was up to any true oldschooler we would have dungeons with half a tier set in blue quality and setbonus, we would have insanely hard rep factions to farm and more.... but with ever increasing ''i like shop my way to happyness'' players, the focus blizzard seem to have atm is the damn ugly ESHOP or other crap that costs cash.... 

WoW isnt a game anymore, wow is a virtual walmart.

Thanks for the thumbs down. 

Now, don't you have a warm pint and packet of pork scratchings to go back to? 

Oh and I think a new customer has accidentally wandered in... 

You might want to go and chase them away, before they brighten up the place.

Yeah same, logged in, looked at those flowers, and was like "naah i shall pass" 

And Followers table was to far away too, so yeah, i haven't been that lazy since i dunno ever ?

-------------------

Being hard and challenging is ok. Being tedious and grindy is not ok. In 
vanilla, reputations were a nightmare to get to exalted. Look at 
Shen'dralar reputation. Look at Hydraxian Waterlords reputation. Look at 
the famous Brood of Nozdormu reputation grind before actual AQ opening. 
Killing thousands and thousands of same mobs just to get to exalted is not 
fun to most people. Why? Because it feels like a chore. It's the same 
routine without any options. Is it hard? No. Is it grindy? Yes.

Is it hard? No. Is it grindy? Yes.

The hard part is the thinking process, shall i do it or not, and if u do, 
shall i give up or go on....So yea there is some hard aspects 
about it.If u think i enjoyed killing each mob towards any rep at 
all u do missunderstand me,but to finally reach a longterm goal, is 
amazing. beside why not add a few hard nightmareish rep factions, for 
those of us who like to reach such goals... if u don't like it just stay 
away?Like pet battle i never do it, yet i don't complain about 
that either.

"The only thing"? WoD added Garrisons and "hiden" chests... Nothing else. 
Many players that played WoW for years are disappointed and they have good reasons to be. 
How is it wrong to tell Blizzard about it? 
Blizzard have stepped up and fixed things befor. A few angry players and they might do so again.

I didn't claim they added much, i'm saying they didn't remove much, people no life a game and then whine when there's not enough to do (Especially if they haven't even tried out a raid like the OP looking at his status) 

The OP literally says the Gaming trashes reply is 'Go play something else then' like that is somehow invalid advice, if you have nothing to do on one game it makes sense to go do something else. 

There is as much content to do in WoD as any other launch (Yeah, not much i know) 

He mentions his girlfriend who has no-lifed (pretty much what he said) since WOTLK suddenly say there's nothing to do, well duh, if you no lifed for the past year you would have exausted any old content farming that you would have needed and literally only have the new content, which is lacking(as is all "current" content on launch)

-------------------

I love how people told me how awesome garrisons is. I thought i could build my own black temple harem with undead females. Yeah thanks alot, this is the main thing of this expansion yet ten year old games are lightyears ahead of it.

-------------------

Sometimes I just ask myself...What if Blizzard simply added the garrison in a patch and skipped all the WoD stuff as a whole expansion, it would surely get as interesting as it is now. An expansion gone waste is all I can say to describe WoD. 

I mean sure I was doing dailies and stuff in BC, WOTLK, CATA, MOP...But in none of them I lied there on ground dying out of boredom in my garrison waiting for queues. In other expansion there were people around me I could toy with. Waiting all alone is something I cant stand for. 

I think I will be actually skipping this one 'till the next expansion if it goes like this for another month.

Sorry but stormshield/warspear is full of people on pretty much every server, please stop pretending that this expansion somehow took away anything other than the 50 or so dailies MoP brought to the table.

-------------------

The game misses the feeling of journey. From my early days of playing, like any game, you have to feel you are going somewhere. Otherwise it will feel like work, or worse a prison. There needs to be a citidal and grand final resting place to take on the big bad villian. And there needed to be a place that was epic where we could meet and show off our spoils. 

My happiest days were spent battling all day and then returning to Stormwind to train. I may then craft an outfit having spent all week fighting mobs for cloth. And then I would strut about in Stormwind and felt proud. Even at the lower levels when we were attacked by the Horde we would all do our bit. It felt like I was on this epic journey. Once I got off the boat at Theramore and I saw these two Night Elf characters on white cats and my jaw dropped. That was what the game was about. 

Sadly these guys lost the true development team at Cata. Not sure what the fall out was. I am thinking they decided to focus on other things. It is so sad, so so sad. The game that I loved and treasured had all the real questing content stripped out at Cata... and what was replaced was junk. And the stuiff since has been just gimmicks, phasing, cross realm etc. Illusions of content rather than real content. It is real content that keeps players in game. 

So maybe the journey, that epic journey.... dare I say that Lord of the Rings journey is missing. The fellowship of friends, the impossible challenges and the sense of achievement. Real achievement, not false achievement. Time was it was difficult getting to Level 20 even.... Never mind.

Some nights, I can almost hear those mining nodes and herbs calling for me while sleeping, reaching my mind bending the rules of reality, begging me to pick them up from that sad, dark, lonely place they call 
Garrison. They scream in agony and boredom. I dont know how long I can last...I must pick them...I must...gather... 

No fu***k that mate, I wasted enough time picking herbs and mines. Like it wasnt hard enough to ruin every aspect of fun, now they are locking us in cells called Garrison. Hopefully in next expansion we will we able to send companions to Heroic and Raids in our spot so they can bring us the loot while we stay idle in Garrison. 

To tell the truth, I find myself logging into game for pure trade chat lately. What the f****k?

Ravencrest Alliance: 50+ people online in storm shield 

I assume if you play here you're horde, who make up like 5% of the population. 

Sunstrider horde: 50+ players in warspear 
Sunstrider alliance: 42 players in stormshield. 

So much for the 2 afk by flightpaths. 

I'm not here arguing that there's plenty of new content, i'm here saying that this is normal and has happened during each expansion, eventually all you have to do is raids at max level.

Agreed 100%, always been someone who just gets on with what we are given, but WoW these days is just a shell of what it once was. 

When I started way back, I looked upon this character as someone who I had grown with, taking them from being a young and inexperienced orc to where he is now, I looked upon him as an extension of me in a fantasy world, a world where I could escape to after a long day in work. 

These day's there is no journey of exploration, no journey of bettering the character, it's just as if he is part of a team with my other character's. 

Part of this problem in my opinion is that there is far too much BoA stuff now, each character doesn't feel independent. WoW has changed so much since I started in 2006, back then it was an adventure, now it feels like a watered down game to play for a few hours here and there. 

I am trying to think back to when MoP was released, I can't believe that I am now sitting at max level on 3 characters with WoD only 3 weeks into the release. Even with MoP there seemed more to do, more to explore, more to actually get on with. This just seems very.....empty?

-------------------

Subscriptions about to run out and I won't be resubscribing. 
Leveled 3 characters to 100, and the questing was great fun, but there is absolutely nothing to do at the end game after heroic 630 gear, and the garrison has made the game less social then ever. 

Cities are barren, nearly every class has useless specs. 
WoD started out great, but ended up being a massive disappointment. 

Few days ago i ran WoTLK raids and dungeons for Transmogs, maybe nostalgia is jading my view, but i miss those days, we got lots of convenience since then, but a whole lot less soul.

-------------------

Can't exactly say I am overwhelmed by things to do at level 100. But luckily I am a raging alt-o-holic, so plenty to keep me playing. 

I am not bothered about what they took away, none of what they took away added to longevity of the content. It is just what they didn't end up adding. 

I miss old style professions to a degree. I miss when players relied on other players for profession materials rather than just getting a garrison providing it all for them.

WoD took away much more than 50 dailies I'm afraid. You might not see it yet but I'm sure you will in time. 

How about you give examples of what it took away from MoP?

-------------------

My raid no longer require my special class because they can get the same buff from another one. They no longer require anything I can craft. They no longer require my presence because they are too busy going afk in Garrisons before guild completely collapsing. This is not making game "easier", its turning game into a mess of an unplayable borefest. Whats so bad of having or searching for a Warlock to get specific debuff? Whats so bad about Warrior giving us a buff that no one else can so we can praise him for his job, acknowledge his usefulness and require his services further? What so bad about having a bunch of useful gadgets that can literally save the group and create miracles? 

What is so hard about sociliazing? People were asking you for the Vanilla WoW style socializing instead you put them into single cell prisons. They miss gathering at large cities and making events. Even the small PNG bug turned into a small, harmless fun event and you managed to ban people for 1 day just for using it. 

I am definitely not renewing my sub next time for something that was once a beautiful addiction. Nowadays its just forced boredom. Anything expect leveling was a terrible, terrible backstep with this expansion. It makes Cata look pure gold.

Spells, alot of spells, movement as a caster, reforge, crafting perks, any reason to level crafting, mining and herbalist (Sure they are there but why bother), flying, any reason to visit any of the larger cities, a way to get rep besides killing 10k enemies, the fun out of half of the classes... There is probably more but yeah... It's quite a list. 

I'd like to add that the dungeons are better than in MOP though, gj on thoes.

Okay, the removal of spells didn't reduce the content, neither did the removal of reforge or profession perks, i will concede to professions being gutted in WoD, but once again, professions really weren't a source of much time investment, there is as many reasons to visit old cities as before (Nearly none) and the rep thing is a result of removing the 50 or so dailies. 

I've played most classes/builds, there are very few i feel were truly affected gameplay wise (And honestly, you got a taste of what your class plays like in 6.0, shouldn't have bought the expansion if you disliked it, warlocks are among the few classes i feel got shafted) 

But yeah, basically none of the stuff you mention is playable content and more stuff you dislike about the game. 

The idea that any class is REQUIRED is and always will be a stupid idea, it should be about the player and was also true in MoP, nobody brought a unique raidbuff, i guess you should be thankful you kept portals, as a rogue it's far more use than i have other than raw damage.

I wasted enough time picking herbs and mines. Like it wasnt hard enough to ruin every aspect of fun, 

Gathering was never hard of course (on a PvE server at least ;)), but what it 
did do was bring you out in the world, allow the odd pleasant hour or two for farming (for those of us wishing to get off the endgame treadmill at least), obtain your mats to make your stuff, help your mates, and if you were lucky sell your surplus. This was especially fun for some of us who enjoyed alting, or levelling chars on a new server to get a few gold in to buy bags or whatnot. Now it's pretty much all gone.

I miss old style professions to a degree. I miss when players relied on other players for profession materials rather than just getting a garrison providing it all for them. 

So much this. The new method may be easy and whatnot but lacks any kind of depth and absorption for me (I know I am not alone).

What's your point you trying to convince people that WoD is awesome? Or trying to understand why WoW getting boring for some people? 

You should have stopped at "Quit if you don't like it"

-------------------

From the death of gathering professions to actual grinding for reputation. 

This expansion did far more wrong than it did right. 

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the levelling experience. The zones were fun and I enjoyed playing through them. Once I hit 100 the cracks started to show. It feels rushed and incomplete. 

I also read that they cut some content that was in early beta and won;t be adding it again (2 islands or some such). That was worrying to hear. 

The only thing coming up it seems is Tanaan Jungle and I highly doubt that plus the little amounts of content we have will tide people over for long.

but once again, professions really weren't a source of much time investment 

Now, whilst I agree with most of what you say I did use to spend hours farming and crafting in the game. I do not now. So it was a good source of time investment for many players.

-------------------

I like the fact that I am not forced to do so many things in WoD. The to-do list that you go through each day (garrison missions and quests, work orders, profession cooldowns, etc.) is a lot smaller than in previous expansions, which is nice, because it actually gives me a more relaxing game experience at the end of the day. I don't stress out each day because of the million things I have to do. 

On the other hand, I guess there's something to be said for the fact that the things you do in WoW often come through necessity rather than impulsive desire. 
For example, I know that I can go out and grind reputation for hours if I want to. But I don't do it. However, I do complete the daily Apexis quest each and every day. 
So for some inexplicable reason I'm much more keen on doing things in WoW when the game tells me to, rather than when I have to motivate myself into doing them. 

So I don't feel as if I'm lacking things to do in WoD. Rather, I'm lacking something that will give me the push I need to do those things.

...

Spells, alot of spells, movement as a caster, reforge, crafting perks, any reason to level crafting, mining and herbalist (Sure they are there but why bother), flying, any reason to visit any of the larger cities, a way to get rep besides killing 10k enemies, the fun out of half of the classes... There is probably more but yeah... It's quite a list. 

I'd like to add that the dungeons are better than in MOP though, gj on thoes.

Crafting was a big part of WoW, for me at least. I used to fly around and collect herbs while talking on TS with friends when I had nothing else to do. 
It was sort of pointless back then but it's both impossible and completely pointless now. 

I never did say that spells was the same as content and I get that they didn't REALLY remove more than they added but it FEELS like they removed more than they added and, yes they did remove a lot of spells that never should have been removed. 

Warlock are boring now yes. As are warrior (I'm no damn tank I ain't gonna DPS with a shiled), Boomkins, Sprists, elemental shaman, all healers, 
The removal of all forms of movement added nothing but frustration. 
Melee might like being the only ones that can move while fighting but they could have given melee an edge in other ways. 

It still IS about the player but when half of your ranged DPS is gone because no one wants to play a caster and the only ones left are hunters there IS something wrong. 
(Tbh I find hunters boring as well but at least they can move while fighting even if they loose a bit of DPS)

Really? Why? Gathering gold/hour sucks, buying raw materials and crafting has been a better source of income for years. 

The new crafting blows giant chunks though, even if they didn't have the stupid profession buildings almost making crafting professions meaningless, the idea that everything is put behind large time barriers with daily cds is just lame. 

WoW has always been aimed towards raiding or PvPing.

For you, maybe. For those people who enjoyed farming and crafting as the majority of their gametime, this game has very little to offer them now unless they radically change their playstyle. I can see how pure endgamers would be happy with this destruction of professions and gathering but for people who took great enjoyment in it, it's pretty much dead. 

Edit - I do very much agree with you about the timed work orders.

WoW has always been aimed towards raiding or PvPing. 

No, it has been aimed at PvE and PvP, raiding for a long time was a niche bit of content. The largest amount of development time goes into leveling content. Not that raiding doesn't somewhat catch up over the course of an expansion.

-------------------

I've been saying this ever since I reached 100 :(

-------------------

While I do enjoy WoD, the more I play it the more it's obvious that it suffers from some serious glaring flaws and design decisions. 

1: The removal of Justice/Valor makes dungeons pointless. It doesn't take long to get the gear you need and once you've done that, there is absolutely no reason at all to do the dungeons. 05e461fbdb77addfviously, I tended to at least do one LFD for the Valor. Without that (Resources ain't worth the time, I get enough of that), there's no reason. 

As a followup on that, there's also pretty much nothing to buy to help you progress apart from Apexis Gear, which feels really underpowered compared to the time it takes to obtain it. 

2: No scenarios. No easy, fast fix for some currency and a easier shot at gear. 

3: Treasure hunts and rares are one-time only. If these things continued to drop things afterwards they would make it much more attractive to go out in the world. But no, they're just good as you level up and immediately as you hit 100. Once that's done and the treasures are found and mobs are killed, there's no point doing that either. 

4: A surprisingly limiting time-based gameplay. Is this a paid MMO, or a F2P game? Seems like everything has a cooldown. You want to craft something? Wait. We don't care that you actually have the mats or you got lots of time today to get more done. Go do something else as you can't work on your professions anyway. You want more Apexis shards? Wait until tomorrow. 

5: The complete removal of dailies means that you can't pick and choose in bit-size amounts how, where and what you want to do. After MoP, this feels like an awful step back. I recall Blizzard talking about how this would be modelled after timeless isle, which gave me a bad feeling back then. Even then, WoD once you hit 100, makes Timeless Isle feel like a masterpiece. WoD at 100 is an empty shell, with no further reason to go out in the world. Log in, do your garrison stuff and log out. They really need to offer alternatives, not just strip the game. But Blizzard has a bad habit of deciding FOR the players instead of letting us choose what and how to enjoy the game.

Where the development time goes is irrelevant, the only real longterm content at max level is raiding or pvping, MoP introduced a ton of dailies and people whined, they removed them and people whined. 

But seriously, if you guys are so unhappy speak with your wallet and leave, they take far more notice of lost subs than you lot who remain subbed despite your claims or "Unsubbing at the end of the month"

I am playing this game for a while now but I have never witnessed SO MANY of my friends in battlenet being offline for DAYS and almost always disconnecting in mere hours. 

Personal experience, me and my girlfriend were hardcore WoW players. I can be a cynical bastard at times, I had the thought of getting imprisoned in garrison with no one around to see, doing dailies and spamming a bunch of boring heroics 24/7 were kinda killing my fun for a while... But today when my Blizzard obsessed girlfriend whose barely logged off this game since WOTLK woke up and told me "I am not feeling to play WoW at all today..." and played something else instead...it really made me think that the expansion already ran out of fun. Another hardcore PvP freak friend who wasted nights over this game bought WoD and I couldnt see him online again after that login attempt. And the list goes on with so many "Last login more than a week" guys all over...Out of all my huge friend list I have 3-4 constantly online brave souls SITTING IN THEIR GARRISONS AFK 24/7. No one is there farming transmogs anymore...Hell being in an RP server, even Stormwind Church has less people than ever. 

I have seen others complaning about situation on Trade Chat lately, your average gaming trash's reply to them was "Go play something else". What can I do?! I love WoW. Its the only MMO I can play with huge player database. But I just cant FORCE myself to do inn dailies anymore. I COULDNT EVEN FINISH MY DAILY HERB AND MINING TOURS TODAY! 

By god, what has happened to this game? I have never seen WoW so isolated, boring and out of content before... 

They seemed to remove more than they added in WoD. The little content that IS there is not all that fun at that. 
I like the dungeons and the few bosses I have done in the raid are pretty nice... But the world is just empty and boring, filled with reused models and annoying timesinks. It's a pain in the *** to go anywhere in the world but there is just no reason to so why bother? 
i keep wasting my time doing oldskool dungeons nowdays instead of actually focusing on the new stuff

Did I say I was that unhappy? Or did I simply say that I can see why people are saying there is lack of content at level 100? I am sure you can answer that one for yourself.

I didn't care about the gold/hour. What I enjoyed was the process of doing what I did which has been made completely pointless due to garrisons. 

And lets be fair, the speak with your wallets line is old and tired. This information is what is known as "feedback". People are leaving feedback on the game for the developers to look at, and guess what? It is what the developers ask us to keep on doing.

-------------------

noticing it to, pretty much nothign to do at high level now exept raids, I am even getting bored on that garrison daily. 
realy hope they soon give us more to do, becuse at this rate, not many are gona bother to continue I am affraid.

-------------------

I have to be honest here I got bored right after I got level 100, at that point all my enthusiasm was gone and the first thing that came in my mind was: " here we go again" gearing, profession levelling. Nothing new and fun.

-------------------

I'm bored 
You are bored 
He, She, It is bored 

We are bored 
You are bored 
They are bored 

My 2 last days in WoD: 

Login. Turn around. Queue for daily hc. 30-40 minutes avg. wait time. What to do, what to do? Hmm.. Gather stuff from mine and herb garden? Nah, I don't care. Apexis shards? Nah, not worth the time. Ah, right, followers missions... Damn, the table is in the town hall, and I'm next to the storehouse. Cba.. logout. 

My sub expires 2nd of January. I highly doubt I will renew until some major changes in the future patches.

-------------------

I was hoping that WoD that would bring some improvements to the long neglected PvP side of this game. 

But no. 

WoD is heaven when you like mini games, rep farming and collecting toys/followers/mounts/mini pets and PvE/raiding. Leveling my first character to 100 was a great experience too. 

-Ashran (Trashcan) sucks and you have to suffer endless queues to get in. 

-Dungeons don't scale with your iLevel so they get old fast, there's also too few of them. Dungeons will be irrelevant content again once LFR opens. 

-PvP is, once again, horribly unbalanced. No new BGs/arenas and the focus is lying on Trashcan and RBGs. No one likes this. 

-There's still a raid or die model in place, even moreso with the destruction of professions. Progress = raiding. 

-There is way too much artificial gating ingame. 

-A lot of classes have been ruined by pruning and stripped of all their previous complexion in favour of mindless tunneling and straight forward gameplay. 

As it stands now, WoD is suffering from exactly the same issues that brought Cataclysm and MoP down.

-------------------

I was very interested for this Expansion and even BETA tested some, but didn't want to spoil too much. But I have to admit, this expansion feels extremely lacking in terms of world content. 

Compared to earlier expansions, where I spent multiple hours online each day... we're only couple weeks into the expansion and I'm already logging out of the game within 30 minutes of logging in. I log in, collect mission rewards and send new missions, gather materials and resources from buildings, do the Daily Apexis -assault and log out. 

I know that some of you disagree with this, but I believe that Blizzard needs to add Daily Quests in Draenor. Those awful reputation grinds would be less annoying and players would have something to do in the world.

-------------------

This thread sums up how I feel very well. 

Stuff your DPS and your balance - my characters are no longer 
fun to play after the ability amputations. 

There's nothing to do in the world, which is where I like to play. The gold/hr from gathering was not the point; the 
fun/hr was the point. 

To make Garrisons mandatory, they have sacrificed the world. And I still don't know what the ability amputations were about; I read lots of words, but they make no sense to me.

I believe that Blizzard needs to add Daily Quests in Draenor. 

They need to do that, and a lot more, to restore what has been chopped off. I have some hopes for the 6.1 patch. I want to see what's in it. 

I need to find some way to enjoy WoW, or I need to find a new game or pastime.

-------------------

I could not agree more the lack of content is getting more and more obvious each day I log in and then i'm seeing posts of people saying it's great and i'm thinking to myself what is it they're doing that is so much fun. 

when MoP came out I remember that I couldn't wait to log in now i'm logging in to collect some mats that I have no use for because everything is locked behind a daily cooldown and I could have acces too 500 more even and it still wouldn't get me any further it's really pointless to do. 

edit: even the music is getting on my nerves because I feel it's the same in every zone I go too a mintute ago I even turned it off again.

-------------------

If the listened to ppl wanting wow to be how it was on release, they didnt listen very much cos this is the worst expansion, other than maybe tbc but mainly cos that was just a total grind even more than normal. 

That said, the dailys were absolutely awful in mop

-------------------

Also.. how about finishing the game, yknow so half the mobs dont seem to say 'youuu willll dieeee' everytime you agro them? 

But yeah, theres nothing to do. 

Everything is like of you have to kill 500 of these but you can only get 20 a day or whatever. Its dull and tedious.

-------------------

Content got casual. Thats what happened. For some reason blizzard dont understand that easy content + easy gear = Shorter lifetime of content. Yet they increase the time between each content. 

And the garrison. Puh, cool idea, But as many stated. It left the city's as ghosttowns. People are just hanging around in garrison. 

Most stupid idea ever to give people the ability to have bank,AH etc in garrison. Gz on doing a even better job at making old content and major city's useless.

-------------------

Like most people when WoD was announced I was hyped as hell. 
The way they sold it, and the plans they had sounded amazing. 
Since then it's been one back track and disappointment after another. 
Every bit of news that comes out just seems like a terrible decision too. 
I'm losing hope, and losing interest.

Then quit, seriously, the only thing WoD is missing is the huge amount of dailies, a few dailies would be nice but MoP was ridiculous. 

"The only thing"? WoD added Garrisons and "hiden" chests... Nothing else. 
Many players that played WoW for years are disappointed and they have good reasons to be. 
How is it wrong to tell Blizzard about it? 
Blizzard have stepped up and fixed things befor. A few angry players and they might do so again. 

WHAT DO YOU WANT THEN.

-------------------

You know who i feel sorry for, the Artists and the Musicians, Draenor is BEAUTIFUL, but we're not really allowed to see it due to Garrisons. We want to be out there! Adventuring... 

NOT sitting behind a desk pushing papers.

And I still don't know what the ability amputations were about; I read

I think it was just a stupid attempt to please the classic/TBC crowd.

-------------------

They say while obviously not even downed a single boss in high maul yet looking at their armoury(yes I know I haven't either, that's not the point), or done the MC raid at all, Doesn't look like you PVP much either. 

So yeah, you have no ground to stand on to say a game is boring, when you aren't really doing anything within it, if you log in and just do your daily garrison stuff, no sh*t you will get bored of it if you don't PVP or PVE as well. 

You're treating the side content, as the main content, and not doing the main content, period. 

To make Garrisons mandatory, they have sacrificed the world. 

It's because of the garrison, that there is so much stuff to do out in the world.

Let me correct you, and I think you'll agree with me. The dailies weren't awful in MoP; the 
gating of the dailies behind other dailies was awful, and the inability to get rep other than through dailies was awful. 

If people could have equipped tabards for dungeon runs for rep (and not that silly choose-from-a-menu in the UI which rep), and if people had all the dailies available from the start, so they could choose which and how many they wanted to do, MoP dailies would have been fine.

WHAT DO YOU WANT THEN. 

What do I want? 

What do 
I want? 

I want my abilities sewn back on to my characters, so that my fingers aren't lunging for spells that aren't there any more. 

I want my characters to be fun to play again. I mean, just fun to play, on a second to second basis. 

I want Professions removed from Garrisons. Ripped right out. They have no business being there, and were put in only to force the garrisons on us. Ideally, I'd like the Iron Horde to invade, raze the profession buildings, bomb the mine, sew salt in the Herb Garden and blow a hole in the side of the fishing pond that would make it drain out over the side towards the sea. And I want them to offer me the detonators to do all that. 

I want Profession skill to mean something beyond yield again. 

I want to have something to do with Professions again. 

I want every Profession to have specialisations that you can choose at 700, like the Alchemy Masteries or the Panda Cooking, with serious rewards for achieving them, and I want to to be a damn long slog to achieve them. 

I want dailies. Lots of dailies. Dailies with factions that had interesting stories. Dailies that I could choose which set of 6, or 10, I wanted to do at the moment. Proper dailies, not these afterthought one-choice-a-day things. 

I want repeatable rewards from kills and treasures in the world. Blizzard said they were going to take elements of the Timeless experience into Draenor world. They didn't. 

I want currencies back that can be achieved in many ways, with meaningful progression using them. 

I want the new models to resemble our old ones (no, that's not about content, but I'll throw it in there.) 

That'd be a start.

I want more dailies which reward Garrison resources rather than those stupid dungeon quests. I want classes to be fun to play, not 2-3 button mashing to top dps chart. I want there to be other stuff to do than just idle in my Garrison. 
I WANT TO PLAY WOW, NOT FARMVILLE!

You're treating the side content, as the main content, and not doing the 
main content, period.

Previously there were things to do outside of raids. I've very much 
enjoyed this game for the last nine and a half years with only rarely 
raiding, and since LFR existed, that's all the raiding I've done. Because 
there was other content which suited me better. This expansion, there's a 
whole lot less to do.I miss dailies: I REALLY miss having an 
ongoing storyline which dailies fed into. The 5.1 content was fantastic, 
do a few dailies (out of a large pool) then get a new piece of story, it 
held the interest for several weeks. I'd really hoped we'd have at least 
one ongoing story like that, but it seems Blizz didn't want to repeat one 
of the best things they did in MoP (yes, too many dailies was unpopular, 
but that particular set worked great, I thought).I miss scenarios: 
as a thin-skinned healer, I don't like doing dungeons too often, but 
scenarios were a nice no-pressure way of getting some gear, currency, or 
just having a bit of fun. I don't get why they were pushed so hard in MoP 
(at the expense of 5-mans), and now removed entirely. One extreme or the 
other.I miss professions: the current log on once a day, loot your 
work orders, craft your cd, and log off system is zero fun. Sure, it used 
to be grindy farming mats, but if you wanted to put the work in, you could 
make progress. the gating is so painful, and removes any fun out of it.This 
world is beautiful, and the storyline in the levelling content really 
caught my interest, I'd say it was my favourite ever levelling experience. 
I want to go out there, see more of it, learn more about the people and 
places, interact with the various factions etc etc. Instead my options are 
mindless grinding for no story-based reason (I haven't even been directed 
anywhere by representatives of the few factions who exist), dungeons 
(again for no particular reason, Skyreach is the only one introduced while 
questing), or just sit in my garrison waiting for missions to end. I am so 
disappointed.

...

"The only thing"? WoD added Garrisons and "hiden" chests... Nothing else. 
Many players that played WoW for years are disappointed and they have good reasons to be. 
How is it wrong to tell Blizzard about it? 
Blizzard have stepped up and fixed things befor. A few angry players and they might do so again. 

WHAT DO YOU WANT THEN. 

For Blizzard to get off their lazy asses and make something worth 50 + 12 that they payed for. 
Starting with removing the useless timesinks that adds nothing would be a good start.

-------------------

What do I want? 

What do 
I want? 

I want my abilities sewn back on to my characters, so that my fingers aren't lunging for spells that aren't there any more. 

I want my characters to be fun to play again. I mean, just fun to play, on a second to second basis. 

I want Professions removed from Garrisons. Ripped right out. They have no business being there, and were put in only to force the garrisons on us. Ideally, I'd like the Iron Horde to invade, raze the profession buildings, bomb the mine, sew salt in the Herb Garden and blow a hole in the side of the fishing pond that would make it drain out over the side towards the sea. And I want them to offer me the detonators to do all that. 

I want Profession skill to mean something beyond yield again. 

I want to have something to do with Professions again. 

I want every Profession to have specialisations that you can choose at 700, like the Alchemy Masteries or the Panda Cooking, with serious rewards for achieving them, and I want to to be a damn long slog to achieve them. 

I want dailies. Lots of dailies. Dailies with factions that had interesting stories. Dailies that I could choose which set of 6, or 10, I wanted to do at the moment. Proper dailies, not these afterthought one-choice-a-day things. 

I want repeatable rewards from kills and treasures in the world. Blizzard said they were going to take elements of the Timeless experience into Draenor world. They didn't. 

I want currencies back that can be achieved in many ways, with meaningful progression using them. 

I want the new models to resemble our old ones (no, that's not about content, but I'll throw it in there.) 

That'd be a start. 

I couldn't have said it any better +1

You know who i feel sorry for, the Artists and the Musicians, Draenor is BEAUTIFUL, but we're not really allowed to see it due to Garrisons. We want to be out there! Adventuring...NOT sitting behind a desk pushing papers. 

And that's the main freaking problem, draenor maybe cool under hype and stuff, but, the true WoW is it's endgame. 

The problem is with end-game and how it treated, i just want to play for fun and don't feel obligated to do stuff i don't want. 

The way gating was before was way more awesome then it is now.

-------------------

I'd encourage the people who feel the same way as the OP to have a look at this thread: 

http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/12976857607

It's got a lot of good feedback about the current issues with WoD's endgame, and a bunch of helpful suggestions on what could be done to help fix it. Feel free to add more and hopefully bring this stuff to Blizzard's attention!

-------------------

I feel the same. 
The fact that i am NOT online speaks for it self. 
Blizzard hyped us a lot with WoD and i was hyped myself but WoD feels an unfinished product with broken promises. 
I start to feel that i have to move forward to other games because the boredom is real:( 

Blizzard sorry to say but i have swallowed a lot. 
The fact that we have no blues here. 
The fact that you didn't bring nights back because you were bored to wok on them. 
The fact that models are half done or not even worked properly. 
The fact that you made garrisons so mandatory and facebook game like that the game feels behind a cooldown. 
The fact that Karabor is not a Capital because that would cost us a raid tier even tho you have promised it on Blizzcon.Not to mention that you said a lot of bull!@#$ to make us believe that you know better and Ashran is Paradise we were dreaming. 
I think enough is enough. 
The fact that you Nerf every single farm spot because you are actually bored to ban the bots?You just penalize your players so you have more active accounts /salute 

How about adding more content? 
How about making game again worth leaving your Garrison? 
How about more Dungeons?Scenarios?Updated world events? 
How about Professions NOT being behind a CD? 
How about working on models that reflect the true characters we had? 
How about making racial Garrisons?Night Elf Guards in a Human city feels right for you? 
And the list can go on and on and on.

-------------------

I'm enjoying the new expansion but I certainly don't rush back home to play it like I did with all previous ones. 

I could log in now, but it means checking garrison or joining an endless queue for heroics. I think I'd rather watch TV........ guess that says a lot.

-------------------

Completely agree, this is the first expansion I've ever been bored with after only a few weeks of release.

-------------------

some things that would make it better already, more patterns for proffesions that do not use, those garrison items, let me me make something out of fur that I can sell or give to my alts if they need, ilvl 610 to 620 items please. 
give me a reason to go out and farm fur for tailoring, and not only for garrison cloth. 

a little more dailies that give me a chance to get some intresting loot, but the dailies should switch places daily to, like the garrison daily does. 

some better reward from heroics please, some garrison resourses dosnt realy cut it, considering how horrible random pugs can be hehe. 

let us loot rares as much as we want to, let them dropp apexis and some boa or boe low ilvl loot for our alts. 

give us a reason to acutaly go out from the garrison, and I dont meen treasures as now, becuse most of them are totaly worthless though some are fun to have.

over the side towards the sea

Whoa now, be reasonable here.

-------------------

I was worried at the start when I heard all these "cutbacks" being made (in terms of content). While what WoD does have is absolutely amazing, there is still a feel of emptiness that you get after a while. I wasn't even thinking of alts a few weeks in to MoP but with WoD I've already started leveling my third. Dungeons also don't seem fun for the pure reason of the waiting time. I hate the queue times! 

What they can do to fix this: 

1- Add some dailies (like the ones in patch 5.1) 

2- Bring back Scenarios as something to do for a cool small reward while queuing for a dungeon. 

3- Add a Timeless Isle like area that has respawnable rares with a daily and weekly questing location.

-------------------

The turn offs for me is the *need* to do mines and herb farm everyday and loading up with work order and missions on all your alts. 

Yeah I know it's not needed but it's there and it's good so if I dont do it it feels like im missing something and it's keeping me from experiencing the new world and other non "important" stuff. 

Also one big turn off is the ability pruning, feels so empty and out of depth. 

Also they destroyed my favourite class and spec, enhancement, taking it even further in the wrong direction playstyle wise and nerfing the damage to bottom.

-------------------

Strikes me that everybody playing is just way too good for the game. Maybe that's the difference betyween the original game and this expansion. Players are able to consume the product faster than a Hoover on heat. Imagine how long it took to make this expansion. If they released a future patch as big as this expansion it would still be gobbled up in two to three weeks. At this rate the player base needs a new expansion once every other week. 

We need to learn to eat our food more slowly.

Yes.Its the quantity.

-------------------

As usual, 85f3070e62845fbf sums up perfectly almost word for word how I 
feel. Except the fishing pond! I actually like how they've made fishing 
more interesting and worth doing, but realise it's not everyone's cup of 
tea. But yes, I wish they had left professions completely out of garrisons 
too. They are great for a minigame like pet battles or whatever, and I 
don't dislike them as such, but it does feel like they have taken over WoW 
at the expense of that beautiful world those art people designed for us.

It's not the quantity of content, it's the replayability of it. Just as the most basic and obvious example; rare mobs in MoP did not always drop their cool shinies the first time you killed them, and they had a chance to drop some (sometimes incredibly lucrative) bags full of additional loot as well. 
Now in WoD, you kill them once and you're done forever. There are only a few exceptions to this rule, and even the few mobs worth killing more than once offer meagre rewards compared to those in the previous expansion. 

It's the exact same content, only in one expansion it was designed to remain rewarding for weeks, months, and even years on end, while in WoD it can be exhausted within a matter of days. This extends to many areas of the current expansion, where content quickly becomes irrelevant, or is naturally tedious and unengaging in the first place. A few relatively minor changes could make a big difference to this, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the content patches.

-------------------

That is indeed a case. Boredom.I really liked MoP. I loved the 
countless dailies and choosing the rep for dungeons. I loved the farm in 
Halfhill. I loved scenarios. Can you give us scenarios back?I hate 
the pruning Blizz did to classes. I feel handicapped.I hate the 
RNG while crafting items. And that proffesions are bad now, enchants for 
rings and neck only? Come on.I hate the rep grinding, I can't 
force myself to do it. I always hated and will hate grinding.I 
hate to be forced to do proving grounds to enter dungeons, like it matters 
anyway.I hate the stealth nerfs Blizz is making. Seriously?I 
love making 20 GR 4 hours war mill work orders to get 1 iron horde sCRAP.There 
is like 3 weeks from premiere and I'm already bored with the game. This 
never happened before. Seriously Blizz, do something or your precious WoW 
will go down to the bottom.

-------------------

I completely agree. Since the day of release and hitting 100, I've done nothing other than log in each morning to get the herbs and ore. My character hasn't left the Garrison in over 2 weeks! I found the end of MoP far more enjoyable than this. I've even lost complete interest in PvP and that was my main thing. Most of my friends haven't been online in over 7 days and one friend I played with every day I've only caught online once in the past couple of weeks. For 6 years I've thoroughly enjoyed this game but haven't enjoyed anything since I've hit 100.

My sub expires 2nd of January. I highly doubt I will renew until some major changes in the future patches. 

Mine expires on the 25th December. For the first time in 6-7 years, I don't feel any desire to renew. Speaks volume when this is the state of players just a short time after an expansion release.

-------------------

i feel quite the opposite and my friends are pleased as well. Some who left when Cata came (Wonder why;) are actually thinking of coming back but the state of the world before WOD still bothers them and the pruning is not what they liked in the first place so i will see what happens. 

EDIT:Given it bit more thought that immediate feeling, i hoped the Garrisons would not been what they are but instead extra minigame completely separate from leveling but part of story and i hoped they would have been like originally so that you can build it in more than one place.. 

I hope they never done the pruning they did but i like it how they made some things harder like getting more damage and healing less.. 

I love the no flying but i feel there needs to be more incentive to get out of garrisons.. maybe good old school garrison quests that actually require you to travel to other places in world..

The old skool guys held some campaigns and Blizz listened. 

That's what happened. 

Now, not really surprisingly, it's as empty, quiet and stuffy as one of those pubs old guys frequent. 

I wouldn't mind so much, but it's not even a classy establishment with a nice restaurant. 

No, it's some backstreet, drab nightmare of a place, with a lingering odour of pork scratchings, full of grumpy mumbling about "kids these days" and "back in my day". 

I think it's more a question of repeating the same shít over and over again. I wouldn't say that they took a step backwards. I'd rather say that they took no step at all. 
The garrison thing was fun for the first week. Now it's just a chore.. and a boring one.. 
Ashran is even worse. First the queue times, then the mindless "whichever side that has the most hunters and disc priests is able to push better forward." 
And that's it for new things.. No real change in dungeons. I got tired of them before I even completed my first heroic. 
PvP is still the same thing, BGs and arenas.. Woopti doo. Like we haven't had enough of that already... 
The only good thing is the graphics update.

-------------------

I just saw that there is a 40 (yes, 40) iLevel difference inbetween the blue PvP set and the purple one. This will, once again, create a huge gap inbetween casual and more serious PvPers and will, just like in MoP, remove alts from the game. 

I willl be done quickly, it seems.

Yeah that's gonna suck very bad.. But that gearing thing I can live with. Doing the conquest cap on a few characters isn't the worst thing... 
However, if there's something that removes alts, it's the Garrison. Who has the motivation to do all of those chores on 3-4 different characters? I sure don't.

-------------------

I haven't played in like 4 days and even then that was for like 20 minutes, before that I hadn't played in a week. WoD is just really, really boring to me. 

In pretty much every previous expansion I had no issue with mindlessly grinding dungeons all day, now after 1 or 2 I'm bored out of my mind. Running around hunting rares seemed like it could be interesting at first, but very quickly became tedious and from what I can tell max level consists, basically of doing exactly the same thing, but more. 

I don't know maybe it's just my mood, but I just can't get into WoW at the moment, just got no time for it (it's not like I'm doing anything else, I spent the last 30 hours watching Orange is the new Black)

-------------------

I liked to cruise around the world, gatheing some rep or gear whenever i wanted, gank some whenever i wanted, but world pvp havent existed since vanilla and some in tbc, flying mounts removed that fun somehow, with people just flying past each others. WOD as of right now dosent have fly mounts ability, but there is no reason for people to leave the citys/ garrisons. and i cant vanish from guards, so ganking in the citys and having fun there is out the question. LFR/G makes people teleport around instead of actually going to the instance. I found Black rock mountain quite enjoyable in vanilla, just waiting for the next dude on his way to the instance that i could kill. Or howabout Hillsbrad foothills?, the wars there?. I thought WOD was gonna bring me some of that feeling back, but mounting up and running around in nagrand is pointless, because most ppl are in the garrisons signing in for BGs or LFR. Trashcan as some other here calls it, well.....Might aswell sign for a BG, then i dont need to bother with stupid artifacts and MORE bones to my garisson. This game is just flat and booring i feel, but maybe its just me getting to old or that im the type of guy who thinks everything was better before. But im definitly unsubbing, because for every expansion i feel the game has gotten more and more booring, and whats the point paying then?.

-------------------

In response to all the Blue posts of "Feedback for the expansion is overwhelming positive!", I'd be interested to see the subscription figures a month after the launch of WoD. 

Well, 5 days over a month. ;)

-------------------

There will always be a, Lich King!!! 

Ok Where hell is he ...WOTLK is and was better, Than this !@#$e. 

I have never known the feeling of wasting my money till now, No content, No flying.. Just pure Facebook crap that bores the pants off you. 

I thought Garrisons was going to be WOW's version of Settlers, How wrong was I, In that assumption.

-------------------

It galls me to say this, but I agree. 

The continuation of the "linear questing" theme is making it hard for alts. It was tough enough in cata and then mop, but I managed to get 12 x 90. Now I can't see me getting more than 2 100's as I play for an hour and get bored of doing the same quests in the same way. 

The professions have been gutted and are dull. 

Gearing up is uninteresting and "easy". 

I miss dailys. 

I miss wotlk. 

Maybe it's just me, maybe I've played too long. I was really hanging on to Ashran prior to this expac bringing back the glory days of tactical PvP battlegrounds - tol bard was better and Wintergrasp before that. 

Maybe I was hoping for too much? I really enjoyed 90-100 first time round, but really struggling with alts ( I said this already). 

I'm off to hawaii in 2 weeks for Xmas and new year - let's hope I can come back refreshed and ready to roll.

and the 50 others that are voting it up remove your rose tinted glasses 
and maybe you'll see.

-------------------

WOD. 

They not only removed abilities from classes, they also removed passives that made the class have depth. Im cool with removing abilities, but why the passives? It just makes the class i play so boring. 

Garrisons sucks, id prefer real towns. 

Follower quests sucks and dont belong to an MMO. 

Ashran city is a big epic fail. 

The dailies bores me to death. The best daily is ironically the fishing daily. Congratulations. 

Everytime i open the map i expect the screen to flash and a message saying "OH MY GOD NEW EVENT HERE NEW EVENT COME TO THIS PLACE YOU GOT TO KILL THIS BOSS HERE AND SAVE THE PLACE!" like the bonus objective kind of stuffs. I mean whats the point in having no flying when theres nothing to do? 

The rewards could have been mining ores and weed instead of putting them in the freaking garrison. 

And the epics.. EPICS are even easier to get. Rofl getting rewarded an EPIC from a quest to be replaced 10 minutes later. Are you joking? Couldnt you have put a "Upgrade level 1/2/3" as rare bonuses instead of putting EPIC on it?! 

And the first real epic you get is a ring from a NORMAL DUNGEON quest? 

What is the worst thing about this expansion? Its the classes. Yeah they removed the depth of many specs. I cant imagine playing longer than one month. I mean imagine getting another 20 months of waiting for the new expansion with this boring 1,2,3 nothing else kind of class. 

I hate to say this but i prefer MOP over WOD. 

I knew WOD would disappoint me the moment i entered the portal and streamrolled every mob with closed eyes. Whats so GOOD about it? What made people go "the best expansion ever" when the first reward is a high ilvl blue weapon.. a blue.. weapon. A rare weapon. First reward is a rare. 

I dont remember anything. Everything just went so fast. Its like doing daily quest crap in MOP using SOO gear. No challenge, nothing to remember, just press 1 and 2 while almost falling asleep. 

The only thing i remember gotta be the orc male that dug some !@#$ and threw it into the water. 

Yeah this whole expansion is filled with %^-*. If you look closely you can find !@#$ everywhere. Even at the pale orc areas. Oh man pale orcs taking a %^-*? And whats up with !@#$ turd diahrea piles near sacrificed bodies in unholy places? Yeah the expansion got so boring i looked after piles of %^-*. 

Btw scratch that. This expansion is better than MOP. Id rather hear "blood and thunder" over the crapy "slow dooown" that haunted me for years.

I love making 20 GR 4 hours war mill work orders to get 1 iron horde sCRAP. 

Yeah, what is up with the work orders? 

You seem to put in tons of resources and get virtually nothing back. 

I actually like the concept of Garrisons. 

My problem with them is that they were too central to levelling and meant that you needed to do so many quests to get followers and now they appear to be too central to gearing. 

Then you have the rep grinds - I've been coping with that, but it's going to get old very fast. 

Some people didn't like all the dailies in MoP, so they answered that with Timeless Isle. 

So, that is apparently all they have got - endless dailies, or rare killing and rep grinds. 

Even if that is all they have got, it would be nice to have options; but not if they aren't really options, but compulsory. 

So, they could give you the option of doing a set of dailies, or grinding rep and you could choose which one for that specific day. 

Actually, more rewards associated with instances (dungeons, LFR etc.) would suit someone like me better, personally, as that is what I prefer doing with my time. 

So, maybe there should be four options in the Town Hall every day? 

Pick one: dailies, rep grind, dungeon rewards, or raid (including LFR, when it opens) rewards?

They completely obliterated all professions and everything is gated behind cooldowns, it's all a ploy to make you sub for longer to do less content because as stated before WOD is an unfinished product. 

It a ploy thats failing as Im thinking I will just cancel when my current sub runs out - to little to do, and what there is just too damn slow to even register as interesting now. 

And finally slumming it on the ground - no flying - that on iot own is a constant nagging frustration that just makes everything else thats wrong piss me off even more. 

Fun for a couple of weeks (while levelling and some gearing shortly after), but all the extra seems pointless given the resulting state of the core game.

-------------------

The lack of freedom in professions is my biggest gripe. Why O why did you get rid of sockets and gems? All that time and money wasted on maxing JC out and you take away the the main reason to learn jewel-crafting? Also gate everything behind farm-ville style cooldowns? 

Along with the lack of flying... 

I honest to god loved the MoP expansion. More of the same, but on Draenor was all I was looking for... 

Where is the Timeless Isle type location for this xpac? Interesting Rep grinds like Cloud serpent guild? Non-linear questing?? I can't bring myself to level my alt because of the linear nature of the story quests. 

But like I said earlier the culling of professions is like a kick in the sack for me personally especially as a jewel crafter and miner.

They say while obviously not even downed a single boss in high maul yet looking at their armoury(yes I know I haven't either, that's not the point), or done the MC raid at all, Doesn't look like you PVP much either.So yeah, you have no ground to stand on to say a game is boring, when you aren't really doing anything within it, if you log in and just do your daily garrison stuff, no sh*t you will get bored of it if you don't PVP or PVE as well. 

I can't. 

I raided in MoP, but I can't raid in WoD because: 

1. They have ruined my main's model, so I don't want to play her anymore and that is the char I raided on. 

2. I can't PUG, because my spec isn't considered viable ATM (only MM with Lone Wolf is) and I am not changing it, when it is Blizz's fault for royally screwing up in this respect; not mine. 

3. LFR hasn't been released yet and even when it is, it will only be rolled out gradually, over weeks. 

Not to mention that people who don't "real raid" have a right to an opinion, as well. 

It's not their fault that Blizz prevents them from doing any form of interesting endgame for weeks, or months, to keep a few "real raiders" happy (or less unhappy).

I didn't claim they added much, i'm saying they didn't remove much, people no life a game and then whine when there's not enough to do (Especially if they haven't even tried out a raid like the OP looking at his status) 

I've done very little since the launch and I'm already at the point of wondering what to do in game. I certainly do have a life and have to work as well. 

I cleared dungeons done quests levelled up my garrison and some followers I have a mine and herb garden. 

I started raiding this week too. 

I'm now working on 3 alts slowly levelling them, I honestly don't have much to do in game and it's very strange. I'm not in a good mood about the state of the professions what they did to those is unforgivable. 

I'm looking for something to do, Farming herbs or ore is pointless as you simply get almost nothing from the nodes that make it worthwhile, And even if you do the cooldown on materials required to craft anything also makes farming the most pointless venture in the game. That is the level of the damage they have to to professions. 

What they have done is fix certain aspects of the game and utterly decimated that which is required to pass time in professions.

-------------------

I'm not bored at all. I'm keeping myself busy levelling a new character since Blizzard totally ruined my main class in this expansion.

-------------------

The happy majority is online and playing and don't look at the forums. Those of us who do love WoD and come here do it when we have nothing better to do and no opportunity to play. So thank you very much, no pink glasses - I actually love the expansion, as do most others. There are things called opinions, but people's opinion of things do not actually represent the state of those things, and this topic tries to claim just that.

blow a hole in the side of the fishing pond that would make it drain 
out over the side towards the sea

Whoa now, be reasonable here.

Except the fishing pond! I actually like how they've made fishing more 
interesting and worth doing, but realise it's not everyone's cup of tea.

I think I should issue a clarification, keeping in mind the political 
definition that the purpose of a clarification is not to make yourself 
clear, but to put yourself in the clear. ;PI love fishing! I got 
to 700 quite quickly. Even my level 40 alt has 600 Fishing.And the 
fishing pond is a lovely spot - but then the whole garrison is a lovely 
spot.My problems with the fishing pools:1. Notice the 
amount of fish being posted on the AH? Given Blizzard's reliance on 
reports for catching botters, the fishing pools are now 100% safe fishbot 
zones.2. I don't want to stand in one place to fish throughout the 
game.In Cata, I had to go to Twilight Highlands to catch one type 
of fish that could only be caught in pools, and when those were fished 
out, I had to fish out another type of fish from pools so the ones I 
wanted would respawn.I had to go to Uldum for another type of 
fish, which couldn't be caught in pools, so I had to make sure my fishing 
skill was maxed and use lures.I had to go to Tol Barad for the 
Eels.I had to go to Deepholm for the lava fish.Now I have 
one of all 7 (or 8) types of bait in my bag at all times. When I use a 
bait, I am certain to get a replacement bait while the one I'm using is 
active. There is no point in moving around or going anywhere else.That's 
not fishing.3. You actually can't catch anything but small fish in 
your own pond until you upgrade it. That feels like a smack in the face. I 
can use Worm Supreme, and my Kalu'ak Masterclass and my Hat and all that, 
and be nine-hundred-and-plenty skill, guaranteed to catch Enormous every 
time - except in my own garrison, unless I pay 2K for the privilege. 
That's just not right.

The happy majority is online and playing and don't look at the forums. 
Those of us who do love WoD and come here do it when we have nothing 
better to do and no opportunity to play. So thank you very much, no pink 
glasses - I actually love the expansion, as do most others. There are 
things called opinions, but people's opinion of things do not actually 
represent the state of those things, and this topic tries to claim just 
that.

There are, however, some objective design issues when it comes to the 
replayability of a lot of the content in WoD. Whether or not the majority 
might still be enjoying the game despite those issues, it makes no sense not 
to fix them and increase the number of happy players.It's not a 
case of whether more people like something than dislike it, it's about how 
the game could be made better so that *everyone* (or as close as you can 
get with a game this big) likes it.

1. They have ruined my main's model, so I don't want to play her anymore and that is the char I raided on. 

Turn off the new character models then? Problem solved. 
That is such a silly excuse not to raid, sorry.

2. I can't PUG, because my spec isn't considered viable ATM (only MM with Lone Wolf is) and I am not changing it, when it is Blizz's fault for royally screwing up in this respect; not mine. 

Hunters are top in terms of DPS and very much sought after, what on earth are you smoking since I want some of it.

It's not their fault that Blizz prevents them from doing any form of interesting endgame for weeks, or months, to keep a few "real raiders" happy (or less unhappy). 

There is honestly enough to do. 
Challenge Mode content, PVP and Normal/Heroic raiding content to sink your teeth into. 

Stop complaining and go do something.

-------------------

raiding has been a nightmare so far I have tried to do a flex run today and yesterday too I ended up being there for a whole 5 hours and many groups later I had nothing to show for because none of the groups could even get past the second boss the pure frustration I felt at that moment. 

and pvp is an utter mess if ashran is anything like that anniversary event with massive zerg groups I will seriously have a headache as a melee. 

and challenge modes feel very unrewarding and it's the same as a heroic dungeon don't get me wrong though the new dungeons are great but we've seen that now and the amount of times it takes to get in a que is horrifying sometimes i'm waiting near an hour to get into one. 

the open world feels dull after you complete all quests and loot chests wich is fun but that's supposed to be a sidegame it's just nothing that feels fun or rewarding to go outside shadowmoon valley or any other zone in WoD I feel imprisoned in my own garrison.

I am playing this game for a while now but I have never witnessed SO MANY of my friends in battlenet being offline for DAYS and almost always disconnecting in mere hours. 

Personal experience, me and my girlfriend were hardcore WoW players. I can be a cynical bastard at times, I had the thought of getting imprisoned in garrison with no one around to see, doing dailies and spamming a bunch of boring heroics 24/7 were kinda killing my fun for a while... But today when my Blizzard obsessed girlfriend whose barely logged off this game since WOTLK woke up and told me "I am not feeling to play WoW at all today..." and played something else instead...it really made me think that the expansion already ran out of fun. Another hardcore PvP freak friend who wasted nights over this game bought WoD and I couldnt see him online again after that login attempt. And the list goes on with so many "Last login more than a week" guys all over...Out of all my huge friend list I have 3-4 constantly online brave souls SITTING IN THEIR GARRISONS AFK 24/7. No one is there farming transmogs anymore...Hell being in an RP server, even Stormwind Church has less people than ever. 

I have seen others complaning about situation on Trade Chat lately, your average gaming trash's reply to them was "Go play something else". What can I do?! I love WoW. Its the only MMO I can play with huge player database. But I just cant FORCE myself to do inn dailies anymore. I COULDNT EVEN FINISH MY DAILY HERB AND MINING TOURS TODAY! 

By god, what has happened to this game? I have never seen WoW so isolated, boring and out of content before... 

I salute you.

-------------------

Well, here's my opinion - in case anybody cares. Hear me out until the end, if you will. 

I feel like most of the upvotes here are just preaching to their own choir. 

I've been playing this game for way more hours than I should have for the past month or so. Been constantly doing something, and didn't have a chance to get bored yet. Maybe I will soon, who knows? But for now, doing daily garrison quests, the apexis crystal invasion quest, fishing, hunting for cooking mats, placing work orders, sending followers on missions, levelling a new profession (in my case)... I barely know how to manage my time in this game. I haven't even had the time to finish the Nagrand questline yet! And we now have a new, and somewhat challenging, raid introduced to us. How do you people do it? How do you have time for all that and still get bored? 

Yeah I bet queues suck if you're a DPS. But, to be frank, what did you expect? How about taking some initiative and starting a group if you can't wait 40 minutes? 

Yeah the garrison isolates you from big cities. But that's a matter of taste. I prefer having my own citadel and only going to the city for AH - others don't. And the most important aspect of this is: you don't HAVE to stay in your garrison. You can go to the major cities, it's your choice. Nothing's stopping you! You can submit your work orders in 2 minutes and go in whatever city you wish after. The fact that most people choose not to is a sign they PREFER to stay in their garrison. 

Now about PvP. I'll admit, I'm not much of a PvPer. I haven't played this game since WotLK, and I remember I quite enjoyed Wintergrasp there - it was simple, to the point and tied in with the plot nicely, providing clear benefits. I've been to Ashran once, and I'll probably never go again unless I have to. It's a mess, I didn't understand what I had to do, where to go, and what the objectives were. Heck, I don't even understand why the Horde and Alliance are there. And the queue times. Oh lordy loo. 

The biggest problem, which I agree with, is that outside of doing the bonus objectives, gathering timber and the weekly world boss, there really isn't much reason to be out there in Draenor at all. Training some mounts for stables, maybe... and gathering boar meat. What happened to the PvP events like in Hellfire Peninsula back in TBC? Those were quite entertaining, not sure why they wouldn't do something like that again. 

Overall, for me, someone coming back to the game after a long pause, the game seems alright. It has some severe hicups (I still for the life of me can't think of a good explanation for the absurd loot tables in raids for tanks), but it has its ups as well. To me, it seems like the garrison is trying to force players into engaging in every aspect of the game - be it fishing, cooking, farming primals or the follower mini-games. Which some people understandably detest as they want to specialize and choose how they spend their time instead of waiting for work orders while doing other stuff they deem is a waste of their time. For me, as someone who is *trying* to take things into moderation, it's been a pleasant experience so far. I'm sure it will become dreadful as content gets stale, but that's not a bad time to take a break and wait for the next patch . 

Well, that's my two cents. If I can be permitted to offer some advice - try to take the game into moderation if you feel bored already. I know it sounds cheesy, but it really couldn't hurt.

-------------------

I want dailies back for reputations like in MoP.... Grinding mobs like a 
bot is something I will never understand... what is wow becoming? Another 
Korean mmorpg game with endless grind? Seriously, where is fun in endless 
mob grinding???? wtf Blizzard.

-------------------

I do not understand why there can't be more than one way to level reputations for those who liked tabards they could level with tabards for those who enjoy mind numbingly boring mob grind they could do that daily quests for the people who enjoy those there problem solved. 

I don't understand when mop started there was 10 trillion daily quests i personally did not have problem with the amount of the quests but blizzards logic of fixing too many daily quests is stupid with epically proportions why the hell they can not find a middle ground from 0 dailys to 10 trillion daily quests. 

For me game is still fun as i enjoy some Ashran fights my self and i don't have to do arenas for my conquest points as i hate arenas. 

-Garrisons would be alot better with more customization and way lot less waiting games. 

-Professions do not feel like professions anymore atleast not to me now profs feel more like visiting a flee market sometimes you get crap sometimes gold. 

-Ability pruning was this really tested? some classes like my rogue and shadow priest still feel fun and exciting but the classes like hunter o boy now the hunter feels and looks that it was designed to be played by cat playing a piano i would never imagine hunter would possibly be any more boring to play. 

Dungeons i like and because of silver level proving grounds must be passed it filters away players who have been there for a free ride as for now normal dungeons were at first atleast abysmal but HC dungeons were alot more easier to complete so it must be the silver proving grounds doing its job.

-------------------

Yeah, the game is boring. I'm not playing at all and I feel ripped off. This Expac has been pathetic all around.

-------------------

What bothers me the most is that for both TBC and WotLK Blizzard kept on 
telling us they would not add Auction Houses to either Shattrath or 
Dalaran, the reason being that if we had them it would eliminate the only 
reason for players to interact with others in older cities.That 
was the main reason. That was posted by a blue (661887c6a03ecdb0).In 
Cata they removed portals from Shatt and Dalaran for a somewhat similar 
reason – because if we had them there we could heart into older-content 
cities and not interact with people in old Azeroth.That was pretty 
annoying, but we went along with it 'cause it kinda made sense.Some 
folks were asking for ages to have major stuff added to cities other than 
Orgrimmar and Stormwind: Transmog, Voids, etc. Again the reason not to put 
them there was that the community would be too spread across cities and it 
wouldn't feel like a breathing, living world.Well, guess what, 
Garrisons have made ALL cities deserted. Seriously. For years you guys 
didn't want to add auctioneers, trainers, banks, so we could be in the 
same place together and now all of a sudden we get to have out own little 
empty dorp in the middle of nowhere.And what is the brilliant 
solution this time? Not allow flying. Smh. You screw something and your 
solution is to screw it a bit more. Two wrongs don't make a right.And 
OK, I get you put a lot of effort on creating the garrison and that's why 
you want to shove it down our throats, but I guess there must be some 
pretty annoyed designers over there having created beautiful places like 
Karabor and Bladespire and giving us generic stuff placed beside a 
horribly designed battleground.Sure, i am (according to blue 
poster Lore) “still able to explore them, they’ll still be fully 
populated, and they’re still going to be every bit as beautiful as they 
would have been with a Transmog NPC.” But who does “explore” them, really? 
Well, I guess I can go there while my Garrison plays the game for me.Thank 
you for giving me the cooldowns necessary to walk around an empty 
ex-capital city.

-------------------

I liked many things in WoD but NOT the Garisson.. which is 90% of the things you do.. 

I feel like Garissons are some future micro transaction feature that will roll out when the game will be free2play. 

You pay real money to speed up work orders and follower missions.

-------------------

As a vivid quester with not too much spare time on my hands I'm still having a blast. I've missed vanilla and tbc but I love this expansion more than any of the others.

-------------------

glasses - I actually love the expansion, as do most others. There are 
things called opinions, but people's opinion of things do not actually 
represent the state of those things, and this topic tries to claim just 
that.

Are you so sure? I haven't talked to anyone that thinks this xpack is 
anything special and most don't like it at all.It's only been 3 weeks, 
no one I know got tired even of the 50+ dailies in MoP, in only 3 weeks.Maybe 
all my friends are just crybabies, I don't know.

-------------------

This is just another filler expansion obviously, they did a good job for the most part, can't talk about raids, have not done it yet. 

But as for the rest of the content, well once you reach max level, it's obvously boring, always have been, always will be. 

Dailies, dalies, my kingdom for dailes people cry....no...these get extrememly boring aswell over time, not to say repetitive.

-------------------

I don't get what else would you fellas like to see... 

Arena and RBG season just started so for anyone who claims themselves a PvP player, there's this. 

Raid content is underway and Highmaul so far is an incredibly fun raid with good mechanics. 

Challenge modes! Running your daily non-rated or bronze challenge modes is all fine and dandy, but that's not all that challenging after all. Get a group and try your hand at gold ratings. Reaching those timers is going to push you and your group to the limits of your performance, and it's a nice project to undertake if you feel the game offers no difficulty. 

There's no overabundance of dailies no more because the Pandaria situation caused a major outrage, and it seems Blizzard put instead a different, more old school system for getting your reputations up. Go ahead and farm them. 

Garrisons, Garrisons, Garrisons. Not everyone seems to enjoy them in this thread which is a loss because a huge part of the expansion revolves around the town of your own. I, however, can't get enough of these follower missions, leveling all of them to epic and upgrading their item level is a fun thing for me which doesn't take up too much of my time. 

Explore the new world. Draenor is a beautiful continent and there's a lot to discover. Rare treasures, rare spawns, followers scattered across the world, many of all of that accompanied by cool vanity events, there's plenty to see and plenty to find in Draenor. 

Then of course all the older content is still there for all of you pet trainers, achievement hunters, mount collectors, toy-makers, gold hoarders, transmog fashion designers, dungeon crawlers... 

I have always felt this game is what you make it. There's a lot of content out there and it never seems to run dry if you have a bunch of friends or a guild that intends to make it a fun and full filling experience. We are having a blast in our guild progressing through the new raid content and we've kept ourselves occupied this past month with guild dungeon runs, guild battlegrounds, guild challenge modes (both daily and gold attempts), guild farm groups, helping and assisting each other. 

A good guild of people that are fun to hang out with makes more content than anything else, but for those of you somewhat lacking in the guild department, the rehashed Group Finder tool is a godsend because it made players more sociable. Whichever group I joined so far (and I joined a lot of them) was fun and talkative who enjoyed doing whatever they set out to do with each other.

Yeah, there IS the garrison and ONLY the garrison. Blizzard just doesn't get that choice is a good thing. 
Why not have a few dailies, the garrison, rep tabards, the challenge modes and so on? Nope! It's this ONE thing every expantion and nothing else! If people happen to not like this ONE thing than they will leave. How is this good design? 

Explore? What is there to explore? Add to that, with the removal of flying mounts at max level, going outside is a chore that many find takes away alot of the fun in exploring what little is there.

-------------------

It is a bit boring on one toon. I hit a wall when looking at enchant prices so started getting my 90 enchanter/tailor up to 100. It gave a new dimension, all that sumptuous fur now had a use for tailoring and a 3k weapon enchant I could do fairly quickly. As a mainly solo player I never have time to get bored in the game. The only issue I have is stuff like DS 25 which I can't solo. If I had good Guildies I would be farming elites/rares with them.

-------------------

WOD is the greatest thing that have ever happened to wow!! The core is incredible... i can only see great content patches in future!! I love my garrison.. i love my followers.. and the fact that i can progres them (from green to purple, always excited to see what secondary skills they get.. and from ilvl600-655)... yeah i have to reap my mine and garden.. i get gold for it on AH.. clearly much better then doing 25 dailies a day like in mop.. iam excited everyday when i get home from work and loot gladiator tribute or bunker shipment.. never know what you get!! and the salvage crates from all the missions, the unknowing... i like farming the lvl 100 mobs and elites in northern nagrand for hides.. i like Ashan, but the reward nerf was to severe and i hope they buff it alittle... people complaining about empty cities? Iam alliance on stormscale.. get over it..

-------------------

im enjoying WoD soooo much that im leveling an alt out of boredoom .....and thanks god that class has more than the 3 buttons my MM hunter has been using ugh...cant stand some of the classes , BORING to play.....

-------------------

Personally, not the best expansion out there. Actually come to a stop playing it which means I'm at the debate stage of taking a break and return or go into wait for next expansion mode. 

It's the Garrison I think, it's good yes but should've been put into the levelling or in-game progression at all, more of a side thing. Seeing major faction cities just go empty is really depressing to see as well. 

In fact I now think that there should be something in the main faction cities you can't get on Draenor or the Garrison. Something to draw those people back if for a short while.

-------------------

i just don't understand people in this topic or people in it... 

raiding and pvp has been ONLY real endgame content of this game from beginning to this day, all the expansions i have played once i have done reputation etc other "content" i have been logged in for wow only for raids and challenge dungeons etc the REAL endgame content. 

if you think it was anything else before you are wrong... once you have done other stuff it's all about raiding. 

and if you want you can always do alt character. 

in my opinion garrison is awesome and wod is best expansion since Wotlk, is it solitude there ? yeah, but that's why we have stormshield. Go the if you want place to jump around with other people. 

edit: 

ps. highmaul has been most awesome raid dungeon too since wotlk. bosses are cool and trash mobs is moderate, not too much but not too low either.

Really? It sure feels like they are getting ready for it.

-------------------

I'm not that doom and gloom about it just yet. Although I do wish I could fly again so I could enjoy seeing the beautiful new continent from a new perspective. The same old flight paths just don't do it so I simply alt tab during them. All I see of the world is my garrison, stormshield, the apex daily areas and nagrand (for lumber and savage blood). 

The garrison has become nothing more than a chore at this point. There's not enough vanity stuff to decorate it with. It feels like a generic instance instead of something of your own. As for the chore part, it's not too bad on a single character but even two starts to feel a bit painful. I haven't leveled the monk further because the idea of doing my garrison chores on three characters is nauseating. 

But at least Highmaul is fun so far. I like the style of it, the bosses, the trash count... it's just all very well done. I only wish that class mechanics and balance were in a better place.

-------------------

Apperently to my guild i should be happy. Daily cds are awesome, being dependant only on garrisons for everything, everythign (even f**** qeust achievements) gated behind dailies, with flr all craftings being utterly useless, most classes being ruined etc.... The game is just a chore. Log in for the daily cds, missions and appex crystal area. And even then they dare to stealth nerf followers and appex mutple times! Only prof i enjoy is engineering now, rest is useless (mining lol) or outdated already (bs.....). Can't even make gold is what i like to say this way:( 

Highmaul is fun though.

-------------------

If I could fly to the places I want to go without requiring a flight route, I'd be in the world 95% and the garrison 5%. 

Sadly, it's the other way around because I've lost the freedom to go where I want to without being forced to do it using a ground mount. 

In TBC, flying opened up new opportunities that weren't normally available. In WoD, it's seen as a "bad thing". Go figure. 

My 11 alts will be sitting in the garrison until we get flying back.

-------------------

Dude Draenor is extremely small. You would pass Nagrand in two seconds. I think the reason they dont want flying is to not show how little effort they did xd

Looking at how big shattrath is in wod vs its size in tbc, i must agree. They shrunk the zones. Sure this one ha smore areas but even if you take them and go in % wise, zones shrunk compared to tbc. Smv/frost fire excluded.I thought this was pre-shattering though, so abit confused here.

personal opinion 

me and my buddies having lots of fun, more than ever since we started in vanilla 

atmosphere is great 

reading through your text it appears that you are generally burnt out on the whole wow

-------------------

<snip> 

Highmaul has just been released and that'll keep the masses at bay for a while but remember after Blackrock foundry nothing 
new is coming out until March and that is being very optimistic! 

TL:DR 

Ability pruning ruined classes. 
WOD released as unfinished product. 
Garrisons make the WoW more un social 
Professions completely Obliterated. 
No incentive to run heroics beyond 635 ilvl. 

March? It's gonna be march until 
ALL THE DAMN RAID FINDERS IN FOUNDRY OPEN 

We don't even have an ETA on foundry release yet. 

Very optimistic indeed. Now a realistic prediction - 6.1 as non-raid patch coming out sometime in late spring, and 6.2 with new raid tier, in Autumn. 

I'll propably won't quit WoW anytime soon because I'm enjoying raising gold and capping out entire account isn't that easy of a task. This is what I do outside of raiding, this kept me subbed for the very long MOP content void. 

But seeing as everything is gated behind those daily cooldowns, I might lose interest in that as well...

-------------------

<span class="truncated">...</span> 

I'll let you in on a little secret, only failing MMO's go free to play, WoW has 10mil players, it would be idiotic to go free to play. 

Really? It sure feels like they are getting ready for it. 

I told this before and Im saying it again : 

WoD is not an expansion designed for user experience in first place. To us players, its just another TBC with content and a few additions. 

What Blizzard really aimed with this expansion were 
economical and player database stability.

Face the fact, Blizzard and WoW lost so many players since Vanilla. The WC3 nostalgia they implanted aimed towards attaching those lost souls back to game. For example : 

I bought WoD from a local store. The guy working the shop was a Vanilla-to-Cata WoW player. He always amazed at me about "how Im still playing that game with everything ruined to core". Yet when I went in there to get WoD, the guy already pre-ordered it and was asking me which side to roll... 

Yes, the plan probably worked and subs increased but it wont keep like this forever, especially in the patheticly boring state the game is in. If it goes like this untill March, they will keep bleeding subs MORE THEN EVER. Eventually, path to F2P will open. Yes they may have the most players in MMO genre but this is clearly not enough for Blizzard... 

My guess is that Garrison expansion will fail what Blizzard seems to achieve, they will lose the subs to boredom they gathered by nostalgia. Eventually at the end of this expansion, they will have no more option than going Free To Play along with next expansion. Hell IM SURE they will use the excuse of F2P to attach more players. 

This will probably how Chris Metzen explain things in next years Blizzcon while sweating and shaking as ever : 

DEEP BELOW! NAGA EXPANSION! OLD GODS! AZSHARA!....WAIIIIT FOR IIIIT! AFTER YEARS OF PLAYING WE ARE REWARDING PLAYERS WIIITH.....FREE TO PLAY! TOTALLY! We are also giving our beloved paid customers "The Veteran" title! WOOOHOOO! 

"Awkward Silence followed by braindead clappings and WOOHOOO"

-------------------

Well, I like and do not like WoD. 

I like the beautiful world, the storylines, the variety of areas, mobs and characters. I like the concept of Garrisons. I like the challenging HCs. 

However... 
I do not like the time-based content. It feels very cheap and it feels as if it was pulled from a 500k dollars budget FTP game. 
You want Apexis crystals? Do the daily. You want more? You can wait another day, or grind mobs that give you 1 crystal each. 1 CRYSTAL! 
On top of that, they are absolutely useless. Why? Well, you use Apexis Crystals to buy gear, which is crap, since dungeons, and lately Highmaul provide alot better gear with much easier effort. 
You can also buy Mounts and followers using Apexis crystals, but the !@#$ part is that you won't actually have the chance to buy them, since you are gated by the stupid-long %^- rep grind. 

Dungeons are preety unrewarding. I know I still am not fully upgraded, however there is no incentive to run dungeons after you are fully geared. Why should I run a dungeon once I'm lvl 630? To have a chance for extra 6 ilvl? No thank you, I can do normal Highmaul and get better. For the garrison resources? Nty Lumber Mill has that covered up. And it's a real shame since this set of dungeons is the best since... a very long time. 

I don't PVP but from what people and my friends tell me it's absolutely rubbish. Won't say more... 

Grinding reputations is done in the *!@#tiest way possible. I know that they are not mandatory, but seriousely, it's absurd to kill 9999999 mobs in order to get extalted. Bring back dailies, and dungeon tabards. More precisely, bring back CHOICES! We don't have a choice to build up our reputation; blizzard just throws it in our $%^. 

Professions are destroyed. Mining is destroyed. Herbalism is destroyed. Everything is done by the system of waiting. You have to wait to get the epic shards from enchanting. You have to wait to upgrade your enchanting skill. You have to wait to craft that epic helm. You have to wait... 

Also, why they decided to scrap the Isle of Giants way of farming mounts? Instead, we have this idiot camping in which we waste days for a mount that will be steamrolled in SECONDS once it spawns because Blizzard was unable to give sufficient health to that mob. I much prefered the bone collecting from Isle of Giants. It was a long grind, but you could've logged on, do your business, go to Isle of giants, farm 999 bones, and return tomorrow or any other day, and it wasn't absurd... 

Imo, the developers have decided to put up these kind of gating content because they have too little content to display on WoD, so they decided to limit our progression in order to not finish the content really fast, which would make us bored to the tears like it happened in DS, SoO etc. 
Bad news is, they didn't achieve this. We are still a bored. 

PS : Why blizzard has to shift polarity. Why they can't find a middle ground that will satisfy us all?

-------------------

I don't understand why they decided to destroy the trading/economy part of the game by making everyone almost self-sufficient with garrisons. At least I would go out in the world to farm for my profs and tried to cash in before this expansion.

-------------------

But all MMOs get to be dreary and boring in the end. Not one of them is sufficiently dynamic to the point of giving players something different to do. MMOs are just habit forming, and there is always a fear of getting left behind. Once you get over that fear there really is nothing much worth playing for. And that applies to all of the games. It really is a case of been there done that. I guess the game makers know that also. They have pretty well exhausted everything there is to do with point click and pick up. 

Sadly there will be no next gen, because players want in and out and fast and furious and will move where the crowds are going. All the games generally are suffering at the moment. All it will take is for a telephone app. to become popular and you wont se players for dust. In truth, these games are way too much of a time sink. Added to the fact the day of the PC is over. Gaming will have to be free eventually, and money will be made from junk and advertising. Thats the way of things. 

PS Its not Blizzards fault. It is the players fault. In the end we all get the games we deserve. That is why classic was so wonderful. It was fresh new and we hungered for that content. The games creators were in sync with an emerging growing community who wanted to support the game. When you have climbed the mountain, reached your citidal, taken the crown and basked in the glory what then? What do you do when the war is over. 

Personally I enjoy my gaming. Long may it last. Getting harder though I have to say.

i know i repeat my self from last post but... 

i don't get it !?!? 

what has exacly chanced ? did you run mop dungeons when you could get FREE epics from timeless isle that is TWICE the better and could SOLO ? 

or did you REALLY run dungeons in ANY wow expansion when you already had their gear or better ? please explain 

i just don't understand what people here are complaining, i mean i agree that wow now a days is crap compared to vanilla but this topic is about game getting boring because of lack of things to do and i like to know what exacly is different ? there is still reputation, currencies to grind, there are some dailies, dungeons etc....

-------------------

I am looking forward to raiding a bit more. But will be honest even tho WOD is nice, it is getting boring already. 
Usually I rush to level alts to max level but I just don't have the heart to do it. 
I have spent a huge amount of time in my garrison on missions etc. More time than I ever thought I would. 
Yet it feels liks blizz punishes your hard work on getting followers very high, as it then offers you barely any missions for your 100's. Then they nerf the crates for low missions. That was a knock for me 

Now I do not have the heart to leveling a alt with garrison followers. For me it was fun first time only maybe. 

I don't know, I have this char geared to 640 now and will do a bit of raiding, but It does feel like my days with wow is numbered. That is not a i am cancelling my sub threat. It is just me saying I am maybe not enjoying it as much as I hoped. 

Far too many problems with bugs and class changes. My fave class which is a lock just feels a fraction of how fun it used to be. The game has been amazing and in a lot of ways WOD is great. But maybe it has run its course with me a bit. 

What I will say is MOP running as long as it has, did not help. It left you burnt out on wow a bit. 

So yea in some ways WOD better than Cata and MOP in some ways, but story wise omg its boring!!! Bring back Wrath story telling please! The story and villians just do not feel scary or epic compared to likes of LK 

The Iron horde was really over hyped by blizz big time... In some ways it feels a bit panto in reality.

Dungeons were an excelent source of valor points. People also used to run dungeons for reputation points back when there were tabards. There was a purpose into running those dungeons. Now, there is none after you geared up.

Ah yeah. I was kinda thinking about it, as being that "lost soul" and hype around WoD. 

I know that kinda expectations, never meet reality but that i actually was hoping for. 

1. Draenor by it's size same as Kalimdor atleast. 

2. I honestly didn't expect class ability pruning, i thought there will be new and cool spells with awesome ideas behind it. Not some 4 passives which applied randomly. 

3. I thought there will be new professions, i honestly didn't expected they would screw old once and lock everything with this stupid gating. 

4. I thought there will be way more love put into new model character creation. 

5. I really didn't thought they will give so much attention to the graphics thou, graphics was always the downside of WoW, but it didn't matter since the game was played for it's gameplay. 

6. I knew about garrisons, but oh dear lord, this thing is i just don't know, it's like time wasting addiction with out any real accomplishment and real depth inside of it. It's not even carrot on the stick it's just well... i have no words. 

7. I thought the leveling wouldn't take me 1-2 days to get max level. 

8. Reputation grinds was like one of the worst things in vanilla, i haven't expect them to go into the past and apply those boring time sinks. 

9. I thought WPvP would happen the natural way like it was before, when zones are clustered with Horde/alliance bases, with shared objectives, with slower leveling, so when one person get killed more and more players jump into confrontation. 

10. Ashran, really boring Escort/Fragment/AoE combo with ton of bugs/lags/queues with out any real reason to do BG-like zone, with out real outcome and being forced, to cap CP. 

Im really Sad, so sad.

i don't know man... that's a bit long fetched don't you think ? what if you already have reputations maxed (atleast the ones you wanted maxed) and just ran scenarios for valors once a day ? 

i know i haven't run any dungeon ever once i had the gear, exept for achievements and challenges and that's what i do in wod and that's what i have always done. 

besides, you can still get garrison resources by running random daily heroic and if you're tank or healer you get augment rune buff wich is kind a nice. it's basicly same thing as valors(garrison resources i mean).

-------------------

Agreed. I just find myself stealthing around in pv worlds slaying random allys. 

Blizz think the best way to get sub money is extend the grind so people keep playing. 

The other thing is, who the hell is the end boss of this content? 

When Wrath was released, we knew right off the bat, long before ICC wasout, lich king was the end boss. And we all waited eagerly for it 

Who is the end boss here? Another orc geneal like garrosh? Come on blizz.

-------------------

The main thing I dislike about WoD is Garrisons. 

The concept was great (player housing woo!) but it sort of let me down. Little customisation, feels a bit grindy, and worst of all, I'm alone 90% of the time. Once I finished all the Stables stuff I wasn't interested in any of the other buildings either, they're sitting with unclaimed quests and dailies. I stopped doing the Apex dailies after I had enough for the legendary quest line. 

If it wasn't for guild chat, my little elf would have gone mad with the solitude. I too have gotten incredibly lazy, sometimes I don't bother sending out any missions or picking up my mining nodes and herbs never mind grinding leather for my work orders. 

I'd quite like guild Garrisons! That'd be cool. And at least I would feel like I was working towards something that meant more than just standing on my own in a phased area most of the time.

I don't get what else would you fellas like to see... 

Arena and RBG season just started so for anyone who claims themselves a PvP player, there's this. 

Raid content is underway and Highmaul so far is an incredibly fun raid with good mechanics. 

Challenge modes! Running your daily non-rated or bronze challenge modes is all fine and dandy, but that's not all that challenging after all. Get a group and try your hand at gold ratings. Reaching those timers is going to push you and your group to the limits of your performance, and it's a nice project to undertake if you feel the game offers no difficulty. 

There's no overabundance of dailies no more because the Pandaria situation caused a major outrage, and it seems Blizzard put instead a different, more old school system for getting your reputations up. Go ahead and farm them. 

Garrisons, Garrisons, Garrisons. Not everyone seems to enjoy them in this thread which is a loss because a huge part of the expansion revolves around the town of your own. I, however, can't get enough of these follower missions, leveling all of them to epic and upgrading their item level is a fun thing for me which doesn't take up too much of my time. 

Explore the new world. Draenor is a beautiful continent and there's a lot to discover. Rare treasures, rare spawns, followers scattered across the world, many of all of that accompanied by cool vanity events, there's plenty to see and plenty to find in Draenor. 

Then of course all the older content is still there for all of you pet trainers, achievement hunters, mount collectors, toy-makers, gold hoarders, transmog fashion designers, dungeon crawlers... 

I have always felt this game is what you make it. There's a lot of content out there and it never seems to run dry if you have a bunch of friends or a guild that intends to make it a fun and full filling experience. We are having a blast in our guild progressing through the new raid content and we've kept ourselves occupied this past month with guild dungeon runs, guild battlegrounds, guild challenge modes (both daily and gold attempts), guild farm groups, helping and assisting each other. 

A good guild of people that are fun to hang out with makes more content than anything else, but for those of you somewhat lacking in the guild department, the rehashed Group Finder tool is a godsend because it made players more sociable. Whichever group I joined so far (and I joined a lot of them) was fun and talkative who enjoyed doing whatever they set out to do with each other. 

Yeah, there IS the garrison and ONLY the garrison. Blizzard just doesn't get that choice is a good thing. 
Why not have a few dailies, the garrison, rep tabards, the challenge modes and so on? Nope! It's this ONE thing every expantion and nothing else! If people happen to not like this ONE thing than they will leave. How is this good design? 

Explore? What is there to explore? Add to that, with the removal of flying mounts at max level, going outside is a chore that many find takes away alot of the fun in exploring what little is there. 

Guess I won't be coming back to these forums anytime soon. I offered you a lot of answers, but you were very selective in only tackling what you don't enjoy and serves your argument (in a very limited fashion too). This is all these forums are nowadays, for the most part - a group of naysayers stroking one another in their dismay and dislike towards the game they are still paying for.

-------------------

Garrisons suck badddlllyyy. I have zero interest in them. 

And yeah I don't log in much either lately. But that's mainly because I miss the Timeless Isle. 

Me and my GURLFREND (hi <333) spent hundreds of hours there, gearing up alts and doing world pvp (bloodcoining >:DDD). 

Warlords of Draenor seems very empty and lonely compared to Timeless Isle. 

Probably because everyone is !@#$ing around in their Garrison.

It's the same as always and the OP really emphasises it. 

If you put an extreme amount of hours into anything, you will grow tired of it. 

I play maybe an hour or two every other day, due to constraints.

This is kinda what interests me the most, other things you posted are not. Because i m not all-rounded player i m playing the game for certain parts of it. 

The problem with PvP at least for me, it took them 10 years of inability to balance anything about it. 

And i m not stroking anyone about it, i m waiting out and want to give it month or two after that yeah, i ll forget about WoW like i did after WoTLK.

That's as may be, but doesn't explain why I'm bored, having played far LESS the last 2 weeks than I've ever played in the first several months of an expansion before. I just struggle to find motivation to log in for anything other than garrison missions. This feels like it usually feels in the long wait before a new expansion, not like we're only 3 weeks into the release of a new one, it's just so limited in what there is to do out in the world. 

Yes, some smartarse will look at my armory and say I haven't done raids, heroics, blah blah - I didn't 
have to do those to have fun in past expansions! Maybe MoP spoilt me; it had tons of content for my playstyle, and I got used to having plenty to do, now it's back to Cata days, except it feels worse after so long of having content which suits me (and even Cata had a BIT more to do). Raid Finder will help when it comes out on Wednesday, but that's still only a few hours filled per week, plus I'm not a person who can stand farming the same content for too long, so once I've done it a few times, that'll be it. 

Just feels like this expansion came out half finished; the levelling questlines feel so well polished, I loved them, but at 100, it feels like they didn't bother doing anything really, just throw a few repgrinds in, that'll do. Evidently it's enough to keep some people happy, but I personally am very disappointed: this expansion had a lot of potential for interesting storylines and content, but it's not happened in endgame yet.

Hey babe <3

-------------------

There’s no content! 
What about building up your garrison? 
Meh, I don’t like garrisons, facebook QQ. There’s no reason to even leave my garrison. 
What about the daily quest, Inn quests, stables quests? 
I don’t want to do that. 
Archaeology? 
No! 
Ok, what about gearing up and then raiding? 
I don’t like raiding. 
Ah, so you must be a PVPer? 
Nope, don’t like PVP. 
Er, ok, pet battles? 
Argh, I hate pets, pokemon QQ. 
I see, what about grinding some rep? 
Yeah not going to do that, they should make this game like vanilla, things were epic then! 
Er, wasn’t vanilla full of incredibly tedious grinds for stuff like rep? 
Er, er, it was pure 100% epic all the time back then. 
Hmm, I see, so is there anything you like about WoW now? 
No! 
Perhaps you should find something else to do that you do like doing? 
How dare you! Don’t tell me to quit playing, do something else? The audacity! 
Well it’s only logical isn’t it? 
Listen, i’m a WoW player, I don’t have to make sense or be logical! 
Ok, how about you suggest something that would make the game better for you? 
Un-gate professions. 
Wouldn’t you just burn through the profession stuff and get bored quicker? 
I don’t care, professions shouldn’t be gated! 
Weren’t they always gated, through either raid recipes, raid mats, and/or daily CDs? 
Er.... maybe. 
So it’s fair to say you don’t enjoy a single thing that WoW is traditionally known for, the raids, the PVP, the grinds? 
Yes, I hate it all! 
So we’re back to quitting again. 
I will never ever quit! 
So you like nothing about the game, have no real suggestions aside from removing everything you don’t like, which apparently is 99% of the content, but you’ll never quit? 
Now you understand me!

Sorry i'm intrested in mroe then only hardcore raiding, but yeah that i cutting edge raid (on purpose sick of that lfiestyle in wow) I'm a filthy casual..... Let me qeus because i dislike wpvp i'm automaticly a loser and carebear aswell for not participating in it? Forums are are fun at times.

-------------------

yeah WOD just seems so BORING. and to me wod just looks like any other game out there, doesn't really resemble wow in my opinion.

-------------------

Well the good part about WoD was it pulled back 9 of my friends that we used to play in diferent expacs. I was happy for 2 weeks. But when 7 of my friends didn't log in since a week and 2 are still playing. 

I also stopped playing the game about 5 days ago. 

I wasn't impresed with Garrison. It feels like a chore and a second job, basicaly there is nothing fun to do in this game. 

Well guess i will wait another 2 years for the next expansion with the hopes it will be better than Cata,MoP and Wod.

Am i casual?

-------------------

The reason why this expansion feels out of place in my opinion is because of Garrisons. They are the reason why we didn't get enough content for launch, the reason why classes seem unfinished, why we got no new race/class or scenarios etc. 

They should have made Garrisons optional, like Tillers Farm, not bloody obligatory since its the source for us to: 
-Make gold 
-Level our professions 
-Buy XP potions 
-Questing in some zones 
-PVE stuff 
-PVP stuff 
-It interferes with the legendary quest

-------------------

Not really appreciating the expansion too much at the moment... I was very much looking forward to it, I thought it all sounded pretty good. 

When it was released (apart from the queue issues on my server) it was really fun, I very much enjoyed leveling and was excited every time I could get on to play. 

I hit level 100 and that's when things started to feel a bit drab, Garrisons I don't like, it's boring and feels forced. I have the inn and have done a few of the quests but I'm not really one for dungeons so that is boring and feels forced too. PVP I do like but Ashran is absolutely horrible and has turned out exactly how I hoped it wouldn't. 

So my main whom I have spent so much time on over the years now sits in his Garrison where I log in and mine his nodes and collect whatever is there and usually log off not long after some days I don't even bother logging him in and I know don't even feel like I'm missing out... 

On the plus side I recently created this little Rogue and am leveling up (something I thought I'd never bother doing again) and am very much enjoying it already have it planned to just keep it as simple as possible with regard to the Garrison and hopefully limiting myself may actually make it more fun.

-------------------

WOTLK was and still is the best expansion i played, i started when it came out. I feel that it was best due epicness of Northrend and that it was continuation of WC RTS story.. I jhope they just somehow continued that one at least a bit longer.

-------------------

Yeah, not sure if I'll be renewing yet either, at the moment I feel like I just log on, do the Garrison stuff then stand around 
thinking of what to do next, that's never happened before. I think they did a great job on this xpac but maybe I've just burned through it all. 

One thing I will say is the PVP really isn't for me anymore. I didn't like the idea of ability pruning but tried to think of how it might make it more interesting, but I just feel like all my classes are the same just repainted. 

Some skills did need to be pruned but, was anyone actually complaining about there being too many moves? It's been like this for years don't fix what isn't broken. 
We've gone a step back, instead of everyone standing in Shrine/Main City queuing up, we're in our own instance.

-------------------

By far I enjoyed only few things in Wod 
-Questing in Nagrand and Frostfire... 
-Heroic Dungeons are harder and more fun to do than just run through it. First time in a while I used a CC in dungeon! 
- ... 

Well thats it... 

Garisson is just boring, like those browser games where you click on something and wait... to win? 30g? 
Professions are messed up, huge amounts of everything needed, COLDOWNS everywhere, only few recipes to craft pretty usless things... 
The ability pruning was a bad idea, more spells/skills more different ways to play and win! 
Daily Quests are gone, now we have to grind more kills to rep... 
Valor is gone.. Now we have Apexis (what the $^&^ with those amounts? ;o) 

Can't say anything about riding, I've done by far only two bosses, and it was kinda fun.. 

Nothing really intresting that will drag me into game.. I was really waiting for this expansion.. 
But now.. I can't make myself to log in even to collect garrison herbs and nodes.. Im just playing other games.. 
By far worst expansion for me... 
I think i will take a break from WoW.. 

PS. I'm just curious.. How are you Miners and Herbalists doing when everyone have stacks from garrison? 

PS.2 Sorry for my english, it's not my primary language!

-------------------

I totally Agree with OP this game did boring fast faster than i ever thought possible TBH Garrisons are just a total waste of time and have killed off most professions now that every and his goat can create anything they need gathering professions are even worse with mine and herb garden that are mandatory buildings so everyone has access to the matts thus destroying the chances of making decent gold off herbs and ore. 

Then we get on the rep in this expansion it is just terrible one of the worst ways imaginable clearly no thought went into it whatsoever just a knee jerk reaction to the infamous early MOP dailies so we have gone from one extreme to the other and thats just bad. It give me absolutely no incentive to do that one pathetic daily in my garrison were all you get from it a bunch of pointless crystals that can only be used for the legendary chain or a few bits of gear would rather have had the option to collect them for doing A dungeon every day as opposed to kill those orcs or ogres till that bar is full and come back get you silly reward and to make it more fun you might get an invasion still not had one so it looks like the iron horde are safe to go about their daily lives as i wont be killing anything for rep as it is just not engaging enough for me would rather get back the old dungeon tabards with a few good daily quests

-------------------

I think a big reason why WoD feels so unepic is like a player in US-forums had written here: 

http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15538884565?page=26#501

All of these Supporters which have been there before, go farming, do professions and so on for fun are useless and I think mostly gone. Replaced by lifeless NPC. Like me. 
I loved flying around, farming ores and herbs, disenchant items I didn't need, prospeting, milling, creating new things. Only for one reason: to support my guild. My friends who love to go raiding and instances, but mostly had no sense for farming and professions. 
But it was fine like that. I used to be a filler for raids when someone was missing, because I don't like raiding this much. Was not on the last places, mostly somewhere in the middle, but after a hard day at work, I don't like to have stress raiding. So I filled up guild bank and when I was asked to help raiding I got some nice Items and all where happy. 

Now... I'm really really useless. 
Before WoD I was able to support a complete 25 man raid, inclusive all who weren't with us every week. So there are 50-60 Players. I got some help with materials, but it was not necessary, I really was able to do all gems, enchants, flask, bufffood, pots on my own for this mass of players. 
Now... nothing left... I'm barely able to support 5 players on my own. Not even with 13 characters... not a little chance. 

So I did the only thing left for me: I suspended my account two weeks ago and look into the game one or two times a week, looking for the guild, saying hi and log out, because I have gametime left. 
I really really like my guild, this is the only point why I read all patchnotes, hotfix notes and so on, hoping for better times. I really would like to play with my friends, but feeling so damn useless for my guild and unwanted by blizz is so much not fun, that I decided to play another things and say hi in teamspeak and sometimes this few minutes ingame. 

I'm really really curious about new numbers of players. How much really are left after this one and a half month. 

Hope you could read what I wrote, had some problems finding the right words, but I tried. :(

-------------------

Ive gone back to soloing old raids for mog gear. Its not that I dont have anything to do in WoD....its just that I CBA most of the time! :)

-------------------

I have to disagree. I absolutely love WoD. The raids are really perfect, I love how they made it "flexible" on both Normal and Heroic. Also I love that I dont have to spend all day, farming for mats or doing dailies. I can just login in my garrison, say hello to the stable mount and farm my daily routine.

-------------------

I'm finding plenty to do: 

Mount runs; 
rep grinds; 
ganking; 
working the AH; 
collecting titles; 
running old raids for the above and xmog; and 
playing BGs. 

You know, the stuff I usually find myself doing at the end of an expansion...

-------------------

Well, for crafting material market that existed before WOD. WOD is improvment to this since material market was basically ran by capitalist kids who have no real idea of how market really works. We have discussed the economy before and after WOD by few players from EVE where market REALLY works and we feel that WOD has finally done righteous blow to those kids :)

Yes. 

Just like in Cataclysm and MoP, -relevant- casual content is few and far between.

The ability pruning was a bad idea, more spells/skills more different ways to play and win! 

Pruning would've been fine if we had the old 31pt talent trees returned. Right now we're all shoehorned into a certain playstyle.

-------------------

And there it is! 
I am not expecting much from the European blues to post here but Blizzard is also hiding there. 

http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15538884565?page=1

Seems that they dont care anymore and it is time for me to move forward.My sub ends in 15th of December and in all honesty i doubt if i will resub. 
If blizzard seeks the answer you can see it in 9 pages here and 26 in the US forums. 

When they will start again making up their promises and give back valuable content i am sure i will be back because i totally love World of Warcraft. 
But for now the sub each month isnt worth for what i am playing.

-------------------

Well i am a bit MAD on same stuffs.But what annoys me mostly is that 
the expansion is as you said, so limited and out of contents.What 
bothers me is for an example that (TANAAN JUNGLE) isn't available yet.I 
know this is for some later part of WOD, but come on. why even add the 
damn zone then.This just makes me feel like i am playing some 
Pre-Expansion when not even all zones are available.Gotta be the 
poorest launch i ever witnessed since WOTLK Launch.Not that i have 
only this to mention, but this is what bothers me, it don't even feel like 
an expansion, and as someone said, they most likely took out more stuffs 
from the game, then added. -1 to blizz+1 to OP

-------------------

Amen to this, sitting in my farmville town waiting for queues to pop is so far from what WoW once was to me.

-------------------

<*snip - flamebait removed*>

For me , Ive never been this "busy" after an expansion release earlier. Instead of feeling like I must log in to do my boring daily quests like in MoP I can do some use in MY OWN place. Create my own gear etc. I love it. 

I also like the highmaul raid wich i clear first week on normal and i dont think ive ever felt so involved in a raid before.. there is always some mechanic that u need to watch out for (except butcher maybe) but all the other fights I love. So thank u blizz for an amazing expansion so far and i cant wait for Blackrock foundry to get out cuz i find it even more intetersting than highmaul! 

ps: I love the garrison music!

-------------------

People come to the forum to express their concerns because they love this game and it's a major part of their life. When something changes that makes it less enjoyable people will fight to make it good again. 

However I am enjoying the expansion. I've logged on everyday to manage my garrison and I'm still enjoying it as well as all the other things I can do. Just leveled my hunter to 100 and will gear her up next =) 

Each to their own but I don't blame the people complaining, wod isn't for everyone.

-------------------

I will not TL;DR this thread only I like to say this :WoD is much better than Cata/MoP combined. Sure we didn't get classes and races, but atleast we got all of the models updated and WoD has better graphics which imo, WoW feels/looks refreshing and the content is nice too :)

-------------------

I can buy that ppl are giving feedback but pure whine ?

-------------------

<*snip - flamebait removed*>

I enjoy the game too, but people can complain if they want, as 8a2f7dcb14a2bb2b said, they want the game to improve for all because they too enjoy it. 

But most of this drivel on these forum are just jumping on the band wagon of over aggregated hyperbole complete with a mix of fantasy tin foil hat conspiracy theories.

ps: I love the garrison music! 
Horde garrisons music is some old men inarticulately yelling "ha ho ho ha ho ha ha ho ho". :(

-------------------

First: No one said Raids aren't good. You saw any complaints on raids? Didn't think so. 

Second: Most of people just post their thoughts on expansion just like you. If you don't like it, then ignore it. You have that much will power I assume. 

Third: Not everyone is raiding, and outside of raids endgame is pretty grindy and gated by CDs. 

Fourth: Not every is whining. Many people have stated quite constructive opinions and suggestions on how to improve some of the stuff that is bad (cough reputations cough). Many people enjoy the game now too, but are posting feedback on what could/should be improved to make the experience even better. 

I personally like this expac. Graphics, music dungs and raids are awesome. Quests are interesting and cinematics are incredible. but there are some flaws that need to be corrected.

-------------------

you do know that by "crying" on the forum there is a possibility that the issue you are adressing is gonna get fixed?

-------------------

Did i say ppl complained about the raids? 

Iam pretty sure tho there are few threads out there of all 1000 whining threads that also dislike raids:)

People have a right to express their opinions.

The garrisons already feel like an optional timesink to me, not really fun, not really exciting, but rather boring.

-------------------

Like the expansion. 
Enjoy the "gore" they brought with it. 
Still have plenty of things to do. 
I do not feel pressured to run dailys and mandotory progression like in MoP otherwise if i missed a day or two i felt as was left behind.

-------------------

<*snip - flamebait removed*>

How on earth did the OP get upvotes for this? 

It's great that you like the game. Even if some of us are unhappy, it's nice that others are finding enjoyment in the game. Nothing wrong with posting your opinion like the rest of us. 

But telling people to "begone"? You do realize that MMO's function by having a community and other players to play with? You do realize that people who are dissatisfied also pay subs, which keep servers running and pay for development costs? 
Also you don't see any of the crowd who are unhappy with the game telling 
you to get lost. 

<*snip - flamebait removed*>

I agree. You should stop doing so.

Spoken like a true Blizzard fanboy. Seriously did you even play in Cata and MoP? Cata was bad because of that filthy Dragon Soul raid that lasted a year, MoP was bad because of that long SoO raid tier that lasted over a year. Other than that, those two expansions had a much better launch than WoD! MoP we had 3 raids shortly after release, one a patch later, we had scenarios, dailies, all classes had a lovely re-design, graphics were beautiful. You also know that WoD costed £5 more than any other expansion pack on release? We got no classes, no race, minimal content and unfinished classes, new race models are unfinished, professions are useless.

-------------------

People have taken to the forums to complain, but remain silent when they're enjoying it, since forever. No matter how good/bad this game is, there will always be people complaining. 

That's not a bad thing at all necessarily, people just tend not to make threads about enjoying the game as much as when they dislike it.

-------------------

<*snip - flamebait removed*>

You know what's more pathetic? When you open another thread and call other people pathetic for giving their feedback. 

<*snip - flamebait removed*>

Oh, because 
you don't give a damn it doesn't mean the rest of us do not. The forums are for this reason, to give feedback to make the game better, of course it will be negative since we give feedback about something, if it was fine no one would talk about it. 

Im glad you like the expansion but if you have to insult the other people with different opinions than yours then better don't open that kind of thread because only flame war will start. 

As mentioned, this expansion has many serious problems and we are here to tell them what they've done wrong so they won't repeat the same mistakes again in the future.

Well guess you're the actual wow player. 

If Blizzard Would sell an Expansion with 2 Dungeons and 1 Raid and call it 'content' and give it a preety name as an Expansion you would blindly buy it and saying it you enjoy. 

Not everything that blizzard sells is good, some times -> example WoD they sell crap and people buy it because it's from Blizzard.

Crying on a forum is pathetic. 

Take a look at this, 
http://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/company/about/mission.html

Especially this: 

We seek honest feedback and use it to improve the quality of our work. 

Looks like Blizzard cares. That's why people are posting. 
Trying to shut down debate by telling people to unsub and using terms like 'crying' to describe their views is disrespectful. 
The forum is for everyone, not just the people you agree with.

-------------------

Blizz doesn't give a damn, this is EU.I *guarantee* nobody from Blizz is reading this or any other whine threads.

-------------------

I too love the expansion. Though I dislike the no flying. 

My question to those who say there's nothing to do. What's any other expansion got that this one hasn't? 

If anything WoD had a LOT more.

Crying about crying now that is original (as is this reply ofc :) What I don't understand however is: 

If your enjoying the game so much why are you here? 

Why do other peoples opinions of the game bother you so much? 

People have just as much right to express their opinion as you do both in negative and positive terms. That's what a democracy is all about. 

I honestly believe that the majority of posters who do post negatively do so not because they hate the game, but rather what has been done to it.

-------------------

I really like the story in WoD but I find it lacking content wise...There is a big world but nothing to do in it besides one daily/treasures. 

It's only 1 month into this expansion but so far MoP is still on par with Wotlk as best expansion content wise.

You're an idiot thinking Cata/MoP was better then WoD. You are really mis-informed about everything are you?. Cata was the worst expansion pack we ever had. 1/2mil subs went down and in MoP it continued to decline to 6.8. WoD increased that by 3.2mil. Why? Players fel Mop was more like a job. 30 dailies a day was not nice. Blizzard had to improvise mid half of the expansion, giving us timeless isle, no quests only an adventure we could go into and discover treasures, get rares for rewards. Even blizzard admitted this and learnt from the daily mistake. WoD has only 2-3 dailies, and you are not obliged to do them.. As far as I am aware you are a fan boy too, I can still see you subscribed, besides what wrong being a fanboy? its my choice and you dont need to judge me for liking the game.

Since when an opinion is based on bashing someone for having their own opinion, I didn't reply he did, I replied back with the same attitude he replied to me. simple as, if you are so bored, and reply non-sense then I suggest for you to un-sub and re-sub when a new patch comes out, because you didn't even do highmaul and also how is that Challenge Mode boost working for you?

"Family and a Job" - I got University/Job but I still can have a nice time playing WoW, you realize that you are replying to the wrong guy. meaning, I posted my opinion regarding WoD and someone decided to bash my opinion so I started to bash theirs with same attitude, then I got reply comment, "omg why you are bashing someone elses opinion", so I started to reply, but I aint going to no more., FYI if you will start raiding in some point, people will call you an idiot for not know your class :). cheero!

I won't be raiding though. I haven't even joined a guild, I won't be here long enough to bother. 

I only came back to have a look at what was going on now, haven't played for years. It's an RAF account so my husband can level up a few alts. 

You, however, seem to have delusions of adequacy. 

I could find time to play more but I don't want to. I prefer to spend time with my kids.

Contender for worst comeback 2015, a strong one at that :)

-------------------

I do not like this expansion at all. 
I really had high expectation about WOD but it's no fun at all to play anymore so I have stopped play WoW atleast for now. 
The expansion I really liked was Cataclysm but it seem sthat not many here liked it. 
I really liked Cata because it had new chars to play as Worgen atleast but now with WOD there were no new char so that is boring. 
I might come back and play later but for now I won't. 
And if I still do not like it in a few month I will cancel my account 
But I am not "crying" about it. 
I am just telling what I think. 
So you who likes WOD I tell you keep on and having fun.

-------------------

Cant I be on a forum because a like an expansion? Makes alot of sense. 

Imo Wod have more to offer than previous expansions did at release. 

What did mop have that wod dont have? 50 dailys? iam really glad it dont have it. 

What did Wotlk have that wod do not have? A 1 boss raid that took less than one hour to complete? 

ppl complain about lacking content when previous expansion didnt had anyhing that wod doesnt have aswell.. 

And i really really feel sorry for people that actually comes to the forum and moan on a game they dont like and keep playing it. 

Its ok to give constructive feedback but srsly? 90% of posts here are "wod is a joke"

CM boost? I never got boosted in my life dude. Imagine, I actually earn my achis. But I guess by your logic, everyone who do CMs are boosted. I guess I also got boosted in endless 30 damage in MoP huh? Where's your endless damage? I guess you were just too big of a noob to get endless so you just got to silver eh? 

And the reason i haven't started HM yet, is because I'm not in a hurry. But I bet I'll get mythic done long before you even get past Tectus.

Like I care what casual players think. Step your game up or stop wasting server space, you clearly have nothing to do only to bash wow and other players with your "adult logic" lol, get a life, if you have a family then they should be your prio, not wow nor wow forums for that matter 

You know whats funny about casual players, they whine and whine about stupid stuff, blizzard listend in the past wow got dumbed down where 3.2 players left. I know all of the whiny players here on the forums are casuals you dont like to raid and want endless reward system in WoW, patches every 5 days maybe? lol

-------------------

Presuming someone was boosted in CMs cause he has CM achis- moron logic. See how that works?

where 3.2 players left. 

So, 3 average sized people and a midget? 

I'll edit in an actual response because you're the second clueless person on that very subject i've seen on the forums. 

Wrath was when things started to become "accessible" or "casual" however you want to put it. It was also their highest point with 12 million players. 

Cataclysm was the start of the sub losses after they attempted to put the difficulty up again.

-------------------

For me, it's all in the wording.I found the leveling-experience 
extremely enjoyable. The quests, the zones, the cutscenes, it was all 
great. And a bit different, because of the garrison and the outposts.I 
like the garrison, the followers, the buildings and the missions. (I would 
want them to be accountwide though.)The dungeons have been nice and 
for the most part fun (the three weeks I felt the need to do them).Highmaul 
is great.The garrison campaign, that gives a small questline or two 
each week, is something I really enjoy, and I hope something like that can 
continue throughout the expansion.I like the pet menagerie a lot, it's 
been a real challenge some days!I think the daily Apexis Crystal 
"quest" is ok-ish. Running around in a big 40people zerg-group is 
certainly not my kind of fun, but it's fair enough.I enjoy the 
invasions less than what I thought I would after doing the first one. So 
now I'm saving the one I have available until reset, so that I can get a 
new gold bag.I had fun going treasure-hunting! And I freaking love 
Aviana's Feather. My advice would be to stagger the treasures a bit. Don't 
make them all available week 1, leave some for later.I would have 
liked some hubs with daily quests (aimed towards the reputations). Perhaps 
with a choice ("you can quest in two hubs only each day"?), so that people 
wouldn't burn themselves out.I miss 3people scenarios.Professions... 
Haven't looked into all, only Alch, Inscr, Cooking, Archy, Fishing, First 
Aid. For cooking, I really thought the Ironpaw Token at Halfhill was 
great, and I would like to see that continued.I have been playing 
a lot. So I was starting to feel like I had run out of stuff (that I 
wanted to do/try). So I came to the forum to see if others are feeling the 
same way, and if there are good suggestions/solutions. I wasn't sure if I 
had just played too much and gone through stuff too quickly (which I 
probably did), or if there was a general feeling of "not that much to do". 
And then I see "the game sucks", it's "lazy" and "easy", with long rants, 
foul language and insults thrown in any direction. And that just makes me 
not want to come to the forum anymore. Cause the statements are so 
ignorant, shortsighted and black/white that I just want to give up. It's 
still an amazing game!

Casual players dumbed down the game and now they want nerfs, sharing their casual experience ingame, on how WoD boring is. lol ofc it is, I look at every casual achievements/logs, they didnt even ones tried CMs/PVP/Raids, only a little bit of the LFR system. If you want a tour mode, be happy that what blizzard has gave you, and stop whining.

-------------------

Overall I am satisfied with Warlord of Draenor, but there are certainly improvements that can be made to the game. And I do feel that garrisons, whilst they are a fantastic idea overall, have some issues that need to be addressed. 

For example, I think the herb gardens and mine was a bad idea. Instead of directly giving you trade materials, they should have instead given you exclusive garrison materials for work orders on other buildings. That way you don't mess around with professions and the way the auction house market has worked for 10 years. 

I am quite happy with how no-flying has turned out, but they need to keep the open world relevant and interesting if being grounded is to remain interesting. As soon as they stop doing that, being grounded will begin to become a chore. 

The rare Poundfist, which driops the Sunnhide Gronnling mount, has created an interesting community dynamic in this game, which is something we have not really seen since the days of Time Lost Proto Drake. Except now, we have the cross-realm group finder which has enabled people from different servers to coordinate and come together for this mount, and make new friends. I think that is good. 

Which leads me to the next reason I am loving WoD so far: the Group Finder. This is an awesome tool they added to the game. Yes it always existed of course, but it became slowly redundant due to its lack of cross realm capabilities. Now it was built with cross realm in mind, and its absolutely fantastic. 

Highmaul is proving to be loads more fun than I thought it would be. As my friends who follow me on Twitter would have noticed, I was dreading Highmaul because frankly, Siege of Origrmmar killed raiding for me. I wanted to just give up before we've even started, because I wasn't sure if Highmaul was going to be my thing. But boy, it certainly is more fun now that Blizzard doesn't have to balance a raid around 10 as well as 25man setups. My guild started with Mythic tonight, I could not go because of IRL, but I am thoroughly looking forward to our next week runs on Mythic. 

As for classes, I will speak in terms of feral druids. Whilst ferals are not weak at all by any stretch of the imagination, they are not fun to play. The reason for that is because we became more about burst and auto attacks and less about bleed damage. I don't really like this change. It has made playing this spec less fun for me. But that is subjective. 

Just my random thoughts about this expansion. Again I am satisfied with it, but they can definitely make improvements. I think as a first impression, it did good.

You're an idiot thinking Cata/MoP was better then WoD. You are really mis-informed about everything are you?. Cata was the worst expansion pack we ever had. 1/2mil subs went down and in MoP it continued to decline to 6.8. WoD increased that by 3.2mil. Why? Players fel Mop was more like a job. 30 dailies a day was not nice. Blizzard had to improvise mid half of the expansion, giving us timeless isle, no quests only an adventure we could go into and discover treasures, get rares for rewards. Even blizzard admitted this and learnt from the daily mistake. WoD has only 2-3 dailies, and you are not obliged to do them.. As far as I am aware you are a fan boy too, I can still see you subscribed, besides what wrong being a fanboy? its my choice and you dont need to judge me for liking the game. Reply to this post was my opinion regarding what I felt while playing WoD. 

Okay, first behave yourself and do you research before posting a reply. Cata was bad because of the constant nerfs we had on the content, and the lack of content we got in the Dragon Soul patch, hence why the subscribers went down, however it did have 12 mil subscribers at the start. At the end of cata there was 9 mil subscribers which is still pretty good even though it went down. MoP the subscribers went up to 10 mil because it was a new expansion and a lot of old players resubbed. However like cata we had a content draught in the end which resulted in a lot of subscribers saying bye bye. 

Do you see the pattern here? A lot of returning players come back to the game when a new expac is out, however a lot of people have been complaining about this expansion and I predict that 10mil is going to be WoD peak. I'm a fanboy? no I'm not, I am an example of a returning player that is very unsatisfied of what I have been served as an "expansion". 

And you still don't understand the dailies mechanic, in MoP the problem was you had to do them for gear, also for rep. In WoD, the dailies, they don't grant you rep, to get rep you have to manually farm mobs 1 by 1 endlessy until you are exalted. Do you understand??

I'd love to see some accurate subs numbers for now and a months time. 

I'll guarantee they will have dropped to the lowest they've ever fallen.

You're an idiot thinking Cata/MoP was better then WoD. You are really mis-informed about everything are you?. Cata was the worst expansion pack we ever had. 1/2mil subs went down and in MoP it continued to decline to 6.8. WoD increased that by 3.2mil. Why? Players fel Mop was more like a job. 30 dailies a day was not nice. Blizzard had to improvise mid half of the expansion, giving us timeless isle, no quests only an adventure we could go into and discover treasures, get rares for rewards.

Cataclsym as an expansion lacked features. Designing/Developments was mostly focused on revamping azeroth zones (useless for end game) so when you dinged 85. You had to do rep farm for epic items followed by heroics and then install gearscore addon and then spam trade chat for pugs. MoP was Cata 2.0 where you had twice as much dailies and everything was a faceroll, no CC during MoP HC dungeons, OP warlocks, which had no change during for the whole expansion. 6.0 Had dailies, 6.1 Had dailies. 6.2 had dailies and blizzard changed their mind mid expansion as dailies did not work. I remember million posts regarding this stupid idea of spamming dailies. MoP was great with Challege Modes/Brawlers Guild but on the other had MoP had the worst decline. Statistics don't lie. Cata from my experience was a filler also MoP too. WoD feels different, I feel more important in draenor due to garrisons, and I hate when people look black and white about WoD. 

WoD has many features, but what I only see, lets say Challenge Mode is a great feature though 80% of the *whiners* didn't even try CMs. Casual players will not try CM of course because their main excuse is that they don't have the time. So quit the game, and stop dumbing down the game more.

You are clueless. I write something, you change the topic and the cycle continues. Casual players dumbed down the game and now they want nerfs, sharing their casual experience ingame, on how WoD boring is. lol ofc it is, I look at every casual achievements/logs, they didnt even ones tried CMs/PVP/Raids, only a little bit of the LFR system. If you want a tour mode, be happy that what blizzard has gave you, and stop whining. 

You talk about changing the subject and keep bringing up "whining" yet not once, in any post i've ever made, have I ever asked for anything to be made easier. 

Not once. 

All my posts in this thread have been highlighting your stupidity which I haven't really needed to, you continue to manage that quite well on your own. 

The fact you blamed "dumbing" the game down for players leaving yet when told you were wrong you back track and say I changed the subject. 

Back to something you mentioned earlier, let's go there again .... you're an idiot. 

Stop whining cba replying to your non-sense comments, cya

You can see that the detail in MoP, the design too, more effort was put into it than WoD, fair enough Garrisons is the big feature, but what did it cost? We got no Scenarios, no new mechanics for classes, no new classes/race either. Cata at the start had some very hard heroic dungeons. MoP never did because of the introduction of Challenge Modes. The stats do not lie, but the stats you see are those of the previous expansion launch till the end, WoD just started a month ago, and I know that the sub stats will decrease. Blizzard made the same mistake with the last three expansions, and that is dragging the final raid tier for such a long time, hence why theres such a big sub loss in that period. 

WoD has many features, but what I only see, lets say Challenge Mode is a great feature though 80% of the *whiners* didn't even try CMs. Casual players will not try CM of course because their main excuse is that they don't have the time. So quit the game, and stop dumbing down the game more. 

Because not everyone wants to do Challenge modes! Why should be run the same instance on various difficulties with only a little upgrade in gear??

WoW Armory has a bug, where it does not show full achievements on an alt, whereas for my main its a different situation. Oh and having 12k achievements does not make you a good player. No challenge modes. no raids. I bet you got the 12k for doing pet battles, oh men too casual, just go do LFR and pretend to be a pro.

Why would I or someone else for that matter be jealous of something that you earned in a Game Like WoW. I play not to show of only to kill my time when I am bored. Maybe if you won the lottery or started a successful business IRL, then perhaps then I would be jealous, but your achievements "meh". next!

Heroic is a Joke. Try Mythic. Find a Guild and lets see if you succeed the trial runs, if you are not at the at the top dps then g/kick. this is how it works in WoW. Its cruel, but it works for the guilds.

Actually I am not sharing any of my personal information with a grown man who plays 12+PEGI games. I am not hardcore, since I only play 2 hours a day maybe, IRL life is more important than some pixels, so link your I don't kmow. naxxramas vanilla achievement, it is "meh" for me.

Within the 2 hours a day I managed to achieve Warlords Challenger:Gold and Highmaul HC 6/7. Maybe moderate than casual

Nah not really. 2 hours a day and doing HC/Mythic Raiding dosent seem casual to me, I just like to spend more time outside. I spent more time in WoW during WoD launch, to gear up etc and now just to attend raids and help out guildies if needed

I'm with this guy^. ad7a15e6a7ab1c2c has been digging too many holes for himself in this discussion. Plus.. 35f8e65d505e418a is a fellow tabard of the protector achiever. Having that tabard means that what we say goes, and everyone without it should be bound by law to kiss our rings. I also want to underline that for us, the game was already two years old when achievements were brought in. 

I'd say the majority of players that have been around since beta/release have been hardcore in some aspect. Just because we can't throw up some Mythic achievement from this expansion doesn't mean we can't throw up older ones. I got fed up with raiding as it never surprises anymore (quit entirely after MSV normal in MoP), practicing PvP through the rest of it. Little did I know that WoD would be such a clusterf*ck in terms of class balance that it almost feels wasted. 

While I don't like the game much currently, I'll stick around and watch it improve. This simply can't be all they've cooked up since the announcement.

-------------------

I suspect that Blizzard has decided to stretch WoD content over few patches for some reason. It could be that they think giving out content little by little is a better strategy than giving out huge amount of content and then having a content drought like in MoP. 

I don't personally agree with some of the things Blizzard did with WoD, but so far it's an interesting expansion. We'll see what 6.1 and Tanaan Jungle will bring.

-------------------

A weeks worth of Questing (being generous), then back to our Garrisons. 

Most likely. 

Oh, and Dailies, Because you can bet they've figured out that only having 1 (outside of the Stables/Dungeons ones from the Inn) was a bad idea...

-------------------

I hope that they add some dailies for reputations. The grind WoD reputations ask for is putting off a lot of people who like reputations.

-------------------

And I don't like the Garrisons™. 

Generic. Same thing every day. You cripple yourself for professions or raiding if you don't do it. People will argue it's optional. Well guess what. Going past level one is optional. Using a mount to get around is optional. It's an open world Mmo everything is technically optional. That arguement could be applied to literally any QQ associated with the game. It's not constructive. It's a twisted truth used to derail a point you don't agree with. Seriously every time someone says it I picture a kappa face not even joking. It's not even open world anymore is it. It's world of garrisons. 

Just to be 100% clear I wouldn't mind them being so central to the game of they were actually interesting. 

The reality is. Sub par, single player, grindy and generic content stands between the average player and what they hope to achieve in the game. Whether it's pvp, pve.... Whatever. You can take the smooth dull coma inducing motorway of the Garrisons™ to your destination. Or you can hike barefoot through the Mountains to get there. It's definately more scenic and maybe more interesting. But it takes 372 days for you to arrive. The entire time your friends were pimping it up in Las Vegas for months. They were hanging out with Dan Bilzerian. But you missed it. 

"Totally optional dude, walk barefoot through the mountains" 

NO. THIS IS BAD DESIGN. *depph bref* 

I'm going to end my rant now. I suppose I should end with a more constructive and rationalised thingy. Paragraph I guess. 
I don't want Garrisons™ to be taken away from people who enjoy them. And I think there should be some rewards for people who put so much work into something. 
The transmogs, free bonus roll, Mage tower, private AH, increased mount speed whatever. All good. Free BoP consumables would be another great addition. 
But this feature should not be the only reasonable road to what you want to do in this game. It should be one of many roads to Las Vegas. Instead there is only one. Alternative. Walk barefoot ("STILL OPTIONAL M80" <-- /sigh) 
I should add that I do have a level 100 that I dinged about 4 days after launch. Just this is the char I always forum post on. 

"Garrisons or gtfo" - Michael Morhaime, Blizzard super secret directors meeting. Irvine California 2013(not an actual quote)

-------------------

how do you cripple yourself for proffesions and raiding without garrison ..... proffessions are still there to do , you can stil gem en enchant your gear just like you did in MoP , cata , WoTlK , TBC and vanilla. 

so you don't have to do garrisons if you find it boring , it's just a lame @ss excuse to hate on something.

-------------------

Oh my god he's missed the entire point. Amazing.

-------------------

because i stopped reading at you saying you'd cripple yourself for proffesions and raiding if you did not do garrisons , which is not true and makes the rest not worthy of reading.

-------------------

A weapon enchant is 15 daily cooldowns. With no enchanters study you get 1 a day. You can make a weapon enchant every 2 weeks. 

With an enchanters study you get 2 a day. 

Your profession just doubled. Congratulations and welcome to World of Garrisons™.

Seriously, stop trolling, and you are trolling face it you are, there is nothing wrong with Garrisons, it wont kill you to do it, and you dont need to sit inside them all day unless you want to. 

If you are serious you are still a Troll because you expect something you personally dislike to be removed. You don't like Garrisons? Tough, its a part of WoW now so go and find another game like all the other whiners who cried about pet battles being pokemon and pandaren being too silly.

-------------------

it still is NOT crippling , you STILL get to gem and enchant your gear like you did in the previous x-packs , just because YOU want some things faster which garrisons might give you does not mean you are crippling yourself. 

it just means that YOU think you are .... and it's BS ( and no that does not stand for blacksmithing ) , optional IS optional .... which means that you do not have to do them to get the same results. 

if everyone thought like you then it's not to surprising if stupid demands start popping up. 

or silly comments like ... what you have not enchanted your gear yet and you already have it 14 seconds equipped GTFO. 

as i say again , YOU are the one who thinks not doing garrisons means you are crippling yourself and that is all in YOUR head so you can have an excuse when someone says something nasty. 

so again , after you made that stupid and completely untrue remark i stopped reading because the rest of it was just not worth it anymore. 

and optional is optional untill you yourself decide it's manditory

it's likely i'm older then you are , in fact by saying you need a "grown-up" you are showing you are not really that old. 

but oke ... sticking with the proffessions , please do enlighten me o great and old wise one. 

exactly HOW does it cripple you , when you can still farm or buy mats out in the world or on the AH. 

how does it cripple you to farm your own mats and enchant your own gear .. look for an enchanter or ask a guildmember. 

as far as i can see you still can do that all the same , nothing has changed.

-------------------

Completely agree with the garrison thing. 

The problem is, people dont realise. And pointing it out, wont make them realise either. Its easy to understand. You dont pay for bad stuff. Period. Only a strong mind can admit you did fail and paid for something which is bad. 
The garrison IS a glorified farmville. Blizzard knows that and its on purpose. 

Only thing that will help: speak with your wallet. Because thats what blizzard is doing. 
F2P games bring a lot of money. How many people do you think will stay subbed just to do daily log-in for the garrison? How many people will think "but i will lose out on cooldowns.." 
This is simple psychology and only very few people will admit they realise it and still pay. 

Im one of them. Blizzards system is retarded, its money-grabbing per excelance. Yet i do pay. I hope for raids and stuff but everytime someone asks me about this expansion, my answer is always the same. "It lacks.." 
Did you explore? or check the stuff throroughly? There are so many bugs, exploits..so many inconsistent things. So many left-out things + things that are.."promised". The balance-changes? Design? This expansion is lacking and this farmvillison is there to keep us subbed..for now... 

Dont expect more, you will regret it.

I need a grown up :( help 

it's likely i'm older then you are , in fact by saying you need a "grown-up" you are showing you are not really that old. 

but oke ... sticking with the proffessions , please do enlighten me o great and old wise one. 

exactly HOW does it cripple you , when you can still farm or buy mats out in the world or on the AH. 

how does it cripple you to farm your own mats and enchant your own gear .. look for an enchanter or ask a guildmember. 

as far as i can see you still can do that all the same , nothing has changed. 

Thank you captain for pointing out the true meaning behind my grown up comment. And I thought I was just being sarcastic but no. I am in fact 9 years old. 

I already explained myself in my first post. It's the choice between a smooth motorway or dragging your balls through miles of broken glass. Both are options. And by your logic. You have a choice. No ones forcing you to go on the motorway. You can still achieve what you want to achieve. 

With the other alternative. 

So by an extension of your own logic to that situation there are in fact 2 choices. And anyone who doesn't like the motorway can gtfo

Completely agree with the garrison thing. 

The problem is, people dont realise. And pointing it out, wont make them realise either. Its easy to understand. You dont pay for bad stuff. Period. Only a strong mind can admit you did fail and paid for something which is bad. 
The garrison IS a glorified farmville. Blizzard knows that and its on purpose. 

Only thing that will help: speak with your wallet. Because thats what blizzard is doing.

because i stopped reading at you saying you'd cripple yourself for proffesions and raiding if you did not do garrisons , which is not true and makes the rest not worthy of reading. 

You need special items to progress with your professions that can only be crafted with a garrison and are bop so you cannot buy or trade them. 

It is literally 
impossible to craft anything worthwhile without a garrison.

-------------------

Archeology in Cata contained some neat i359 items to discover as well. Was Archy considered mandatory and forced? Maybe to Method. But to average player wanting to enjoy the content, hell no. 

I like garrisons. They're even more fun if you build a small garrison empire on your account and use them to your advantage to make huge amounts of gold. The goldmaking potential in those things is almost limitless. Went from 1,3 to 1,8 million since launch, almost solely on garrisons. Barely did any flipping and shuffling on AH. Just used my professions and garrisons correctly. 

Currently sitting at four pimped out garrisons and it will propably expand over time. Who knows what goodies wait for me with the second raid tier release in 2015?

No problem. I like people liek you who arent afraid to critique a product. This Farmville !@#$ really bugs me. And lets face it. Blizzard friggin knows that. They arent dumber than us. they are smarter. Sit back and think 5 min about what a merchandise seller would do. Its their choice to do what they do. The designers get told what to design. We can just vote with money. Im just enjoying the rest of the game too much right now =/ aka its worth my money for the moment. 

Ontop of that my brain always tells me: "..but look at what garrisons could be!" 
And then i realise it.."could be". I have so many ideas to make garrisons better. Then i realise "wait..the designers must have had them, too" and we can be sure they had, but they choose this system. You can answer this yourself why they choose this instead of a more polished, ungrindy one..

EVERYONE STOP!This guy here is not enjoying Garrisons, REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELY! No no no, it does not matter if the majority are enjoying it. -This- guy does not so it must be removed AT ONCE!Seriously, stop trolling, and you are trolling face it you are, there is nothing wrong with Garrisons, it wont kill you to do it, and you dont need to sit inside them all day unless you want to.If you are serious you are still a Troll because you expect something you personally dislike to be removed. You don't like Garrisons? Tough, its a part of WoW now so go and find another game like all the other whiners who cried about pet battles being pokemon and pandaren being too silly. 

Someone else who doesn't know what trolling is...

-------------------

I think e19a14254862ff58 has a very limited understanding of the English language. Being crippled doesn't mean completely useless. It's very insensitive of you to think of the word crippled like that. You think of crippled people the same way? 

I semi-like the idea of Garrison.. I don't like the fact that mining and herbalism are two extremely watered-down professions now and I really don't want to run the Lunarfart Excavation once a day on all my alts. Nor do I wish to spend several thousands of gold on plans to upgrade my garrison buildings to level 3 on all my alts. Yet; I feel as if I can't progress as much as I want if I don't. 

I've made a bit of gold selling Shredirons Shredder and other items. If I had been arsed to bother with my alts garrisons I would have been able to make 5-10 Shredirons Shredders by now and made even more gold. But the tediousness of the garrison dailies is just unparallelled, while I intend to level all my alts to level 100. I've felt almost forced to do it now before 3rd of December to get as much out of the professions as possible before the raiding starts and the prices plummet. 

But alas studying and RL stuff has gotten priority and here I am, 300.000 gold poorer than my brother who actually bothered with his alts garrisons. Ugh :(

Absolutely. It could easily be developed into a full micro transaction platform in wow. Wouldnt be surprised if it were in the long term plans. Have you seen the South park episode 'freemium isn't free'. 

It's actually really clever satire on these kinds of mobile / fb games 

I'd said on older forum posts that garrisons would be released as Alpha. So they use improvements to sell more expansions. Features and customisation that should have been baseline on release. I mean. It's ok to hold some features back of course. All game designers do this. But for me, they held back too many for that rainy day where they cash in on 'new' features.

what is impossible to craft without a garry level 1 with nothing in it? 
all the bop mats can be made by your proffesion and the bloods can be farmed(the time it takes is a nightmare 750 spirits per 15 bloods)

I played my fair share of F2P games and while never spending a dime on them, i knew people, and im not kidding you, did spend thousands of eruos on F2P games. Thousands. Why? I cant tell you that. But i cant deny the truth... 

On the topic...i guess we just need to wait and re-sub when the game is actually in a better state or so. It really depends. And i do think that the vast mayority of players will cancel their sub after this raid-tier

If it is cripple your professions? No. 

However, I do see a resemblance to the garrison and FarmVille. 
Blizzard has been notorious in the past to copy whatever in the gaming world seems popular. take a look at WOTLK. Shortly before WOTLK was announced, Microsoft announced achivements for xbox live. Blizzard jumped on that wagon and for a long time, people wondered what these achivement points were actually good for. Some said they could be traded for mounts and other goodies. 

It's Blizzard in a nutshell to create ideas out of what seems to be popular at this spot. FarmVille has had great success on the internet that past couple of years, so I'm ot surprised that we'd see something like it. 

Was it handled correctly? No, but it does what it does and it has some benefits. However I can easily imagine WoD without it and it wouldn't be an idea I would hate - if it weren't for the fact that we'd be doing exactly what we did in MoP. 

I like the Garrison, I can make some cool !@#$ in there and while most of it aren't really useful I find it enjoyable enough for the time being. As long as it isn't more than it is now then I'm fine with it.

Agreed. 

Also i just remembered. Housing. Blizz didnt want to implement just housing...but for some reason i think garrison is some sort of housing replacement. Now my point is..when i first raid i get my own castle i wa slike "OMG COOL" and then i quickly got back on my feet and thought "..where is the negative point now?" 

the garrison has absolutely 0 customizability. Its such a shame. Not race-like stuff. No vast majority of buildings. Just a selected few with samish look, daily cooldowns tied to it. This reminds me actually of smartphone games where you place your lil* 4 inch building and it looks kinda cool...for 5 seconds. 
There could be so much more..and yet there is nothing. In my head it still WANTS to be a cool idea, but ingame its just so..dumb

-------------------

obviously , because i tell it like it is and call you out on your own BS it's impossible to have a decent discussion. 
and with that people show their age and ignorance. 

again , you do not cripple yourself without a garrison , everything you need can still be obtained via traditional means , and even IF you have to wait a bit longer or do not have the absolute best of the best there currently is out there , even then it still does not mean you limit yourself , that is just all in your head. 

even being less then optimal you can still outpreform people. 

so yes it is BS what you are saying and impying that you can not have a decent discussion with someone who has either a different view on things OR calls you out just shows the true colours you posses ( aka the i'm always right and you are always wrong mentallity ). 

and also 

I think e19a14254862ff58 has a very limited understanding of the English language. Being crippled doesn't mean completely useless. It's very insensitive of you to think of the word crippled like that. You think of crippled people the same way? 

i do have a decent grasp on the english language and i do know there are multiple interpitations to the word , just because i'm not fluid and may make mistakes does not mean i do not know things. 

also , where the hell did i ever say that crippled means useless , i never said anything like that and implying i did is highly rude and offensive. 
also i would never think to call people with a physical disabillity , crippled .. specially not since i know people who have a disabillity and are probably a whole lot more usefull and active then a lot of able people out there. 

so don't go implying i said things i did not say

-------------------

It's not in my head. It's in the fact that I can make exactly double the enchants with a Garrison. That is not open to interpretation. 

That is a 100% profession boost. Not some mental perception.

so you can make double of what you need , i still do not see what is crippling about it. 

you need a weapon enchant ... the only way getting double the weapon enchants is of any benifit is if you dual wield OR if you know you'll replace your weapons in a very short timeframe. 

other then that i see no real gain.

I guess you just dont know what "crippling" means. Case solved. 

Example. 

A person owns a company which produces 10 chocolate-bars a day. 
If he now purchases another bulding, he could produce 20 bars a day. Many other company owners did exactly that. Is the person now crippled because he didnt purchse another building to produce more bars? Yes he is.

I'm aware it was just an example. Those matts will be cheaper come tommorow. But there are LOTS of other professions where the 100% boost remains a constant through all content. JC, eng, inscription will remain constricted. Those are the only 4 I have atm so can't comment on others.

You even just proved his point. It's stunning how dense you are.Choosing 
to not use a garrison makes things longer and harder. You seem to grasp 
this point; I'm not sure how you get lost after that...? That's the very 
definition of crippling yourself. Sometimes referred to as gimping 
yourself.Anyway, @664fb7ffb7ad448d:I agree completely. I 
remember the countless reassurances during development that garrisons 
would not be mandatory. However, what they still don't seem to realise is 
people will always take the best and fastest path to achieving what they 
want to achieve. And garrisons is the way to do that.

the fact that you can get mythic gear from follower missions which kinda forces you to use your garrison, which is just bs in my eyes. i dont mind that you get proffesions advantages, transmogs, mounts and what so ever i can live with that people got an edge over me in stuff like that just bcos i dont wanna play farmville but that they get raid appropiate gear is just lame

and it's still not crippling , without a garrison you still get your items , it just takes longer. 

OP and you would have a point if the ONLY way was having a garrison , but it's not. 

"If someone broke one of your legs, you would not be crippled because you still have the other one. You could get some crutches and hobble about slowly or even just drag yourself along. People would have a point if having legs was the ONLY way to get around, but it's not." 

That's basically your logic. Sounds stupid? That's because it is.

This is a can of worms but yeh I agree with it. Normal/hc gear from missions I don't really mind. But for me I think hard mode gear should only be obtainable from hard mode bosses. It's not even a I don't want other people to have nice things attitude or an elitist thing. 

More from a traditionalist sort of thing. You kill the big dragon and you get the loot. Getting it through the Garrison is just.... I dunno. I feel the same way about legendaries too. I'm in a guild with 30 people, if there were a legendary obtainable only in raids I would not get it. I'd still prefer that system to come back than the everybodies a winner sort of approach. Epics should be epic and legendaries, legendary. 

If a guy on your server had double war glaives you knew who the hell he was. 

Mythic gear in garrisons just seems so against that whole idea. Slay the dragon with your friends, get the loot. Play candy crush on your own, get the loot? :/ 

Hard to not come across as a douche when I'm someone who gets that kind of gear. But yeh. Not apologising for that Id feel the same if I stopped raiding.

I usually agree with all your post fella but this part i call BS sorry . 

Epics havent been "Epic" since MC/ZG where on farm in classic . 

As for legendarys the last true one was a classic one tbh the staff and the Bow from SwP. 

People where selling boosts in BT for a chance at glavies back in tbc. 

guilds where also selling boosts for mace and 2 hander in wotlk 

ds daggers where just farming and a few scene's .same with fl staff. 

all this BS about epics blalalla and legeies is horse manure tbh .i got my first biding in classic for my thundefury and it took me another 6 years to get the other one to drop its just RnG nothing hard about it .

That comment was directed towards the idea of mythic gear dropping from missions. I frankly don't care if it rains normal gear. My point was that the hardest gear shouldn't be in that rain, for me that's too far. 

As for legendaries only the glaives were RNG anything else a guild funnelled the items into 1-2 players that's not RNG. That is deliberate. 

Ok for example. The plate shoulders from garrosh, tusks of mannoroth. 0.07% drop chance on the last boss of an expansion. That's cool, even if it's rng. The 6 cloaks? Possibly the 6 most common pieces of gear in the game period. That's not legendary it's mandatory. A raider in your group with a legendary should be a powerhouse. The cloak was a requirement to join literally any raiding guild in 5.4. Not a nice little bonus, mandatory. As in application declined. 

To me that is bs, there need to be some things that are extremely rare or powerful in the game. It's an RPG.

what is impossible to craft without a garry level 1 with nothing in it? 

You can't get the fractured crystal thingies (can't remember what they're called and don't really care) for enchanting, 10 of which make a whole crystal. 

So, you then only have a chance at getting a whole crystal, once a day (you may not even get a whole one) and you need at least 4 of them for every decent quality enchant. 

So, it severely limits you. 

TBH, the whole enchanting thing probably needs adjustment, anyway, as you don't even get many of the fractured ones from a level 2 enchanting building, per day, even when you tend to make new work orders as soon as the old ones expire. 

The mine means you get plenty of ore and the herb garden the same, but getting a half decent quantity of the right enchanting mats is hard work. 

Of course, this may all change with the opening of the raids, IDK.

My problem with it is that it forces people to do the content, even if they don't want to, to try to get the gear. 

If, for example, the very occasional piece of Mythic quality gear dropped from absolutely any mob (i.e. not a world boss, or a rare - any mob) out in the world, then it would be fine. 

As no one would feel forced to do content they wouldn't otherwise do, because it would be completely unfarmable. 

But, when it is tied to the garrison, it makes people feel they are mandatory. 

TBH, I quite like the garrison, but what ruins it for me is that it is required content; not entirely optional. 

I didn't, on the other hand, have a problem with the legendary cloak being farmable in LFR, because if you enjoy raiding, the only real reason to disapprove of LFR (and people getting their legendary via LFR) is snobbery. 

Doing LFR wasn't mandatory to farm the items for the legendary - you could also farm them in other difficulties. 

So, it's not the same thing as this situation with garrisons, at all.

OK, fair enough. :) 

I think there should be other ways for non-raiders (or more casual raiders) to get decent gear, too. 

However, the problem is, how do you do it without raiders feeling they have to also do those things, to keep up? 

The thing is, this isn't just about elitism, it's also about the pressure people feel under to get the very best advantages, in terms of gear, to keep up with the rest of the raiding community. 

If you love raiding and are in danger of losing your raid spot, because you really don't enjoy garrisons, it's understandable if you're a bit miffed.

There's nothing elitist about not enjoying being forced to do Blizzard's flavour of the month feature in order to compete. 
Many people do not wish to plough their time and effort into their garrison, and it is acceptable for them to object to feeling forced into doing so. 
World of Warcraft is an RPG first and foremost - that is the core of the game and the RPG elements are what the game should focus on. The minigames that Blizzard introduce are fun and engaging but they should not effect the outcome of the RPG at the heart of the game. 

I personally very much enjoy the garrison, but can see that for those who wish to play World of Warcraft it is very frustrating to have to devote a huge amount of time and effort into the garrison minigames. 

Imagine if you had to participate in pet battles to gain double crafting resources each day. I genuinely would be playing the game far less if that were the case - perhaps even stop altogether - and this must be how those who begrudgingly grind through the garrison system must be feeling.

Oh well I knew this would happen when I said that. I care about beating bosses while they're current, that's fun for me atm. Gear is a tool for doing it and a reward for being successful. 

I get jelly when I see people with nice PvP titles but the prestige of something like the gladiator title is what makes it cool. Learning to not be crap at pvp is on a to do list for me in this game. Would never get glad but some of the easier ones if I applied myself to it. For me the rewards are motivation to go and do that. 

If a gladiator mount had a 0.01% drop on a particular mission to me that would be wrong. Let me guess am I a pvp elitist now? Oh wait. I don't pvp. I just have a genuine opinion about something and your branding me a snob in order to undermine my point

-------------------

I currently have over 100 Temporal Crystals over 1000 draenic dust and millions of sumptuous fur, Why you ask? Because I don't have anything else to do with them as all my orders are updated by orders that come in for the crystals I'm scared to even use them mainly because how hard they're to come across. 

The only good thing they done with professions in my opinion was give you recipes as you leveled cooking. 

It was as if you experimented with food and came up with new ideas and you could easily level it and make what you wanted without being 

EDIT: Though when this tier is done you'll find professions will be not as important due to Mythic last tier gear I suppose.

Well. When highmaul hits in a few hours you may regret not cashing out. DE'd epics give a crystal. People won't raid till evening so you have all of tomo to sell them. The amount of crystals in existence will be 10 fold very soon and prices will plummet. For other profs the profession daily will still be a ceiling though

-------------------

Just about got my Garrison to full Level 3 and enjoyed doing so. BUT, the restriction of 3 crafted pieces of gear per person and the existence of only 3 enchant slots makes me wonder if Garrisons will be abandoned by people in a few months time. Won't the market for crafted gear/enchants become very small? Even allowing for alts I don't see how a thriving market can exist. I have already stock-piled basic mats. Garrison resources will soon be piling up with nothing to spend them on. I don't see a how people will be motivated to invest much time in ongoing maintenance of their Garrison. Already I don't need any products from my 2 professions and i can sell things in the short term, but I see that market quickly disappearing. Thoughts people?

Yeah, quite possibly. 

As I say, garrisons feel compulsory now, but it could be that they will very soon feel entirely optional, again. 

Unless, of course, they add higher ilvl gear to them, with the next tier, which they may very well do.

Just wait 2-3 moonths people will run away from their garrisons like rats from flood ! because boredom....

Yeah no, your comparison does not even make a tiny bit of sense, you are talking about a mount, something cosmetic and vanity, you do realize there is PVP gear in the game too right? As a matter of fact I do think Garrisons should offer a path to PVP gear too since they do so for PVE. 

But you made my point for me, you get your rare raid mounts and achievements, ditto with PVPers with the 'elite' vanity gear and mount, so yeah it is elitist of you to want to restrict GEAR to only one method of acquiring it.

I don't want to restrict anything. There is a linear gearing path from LFR, normal, heroic & mythic. By the time you progress through normal and heroic collecting your gear to get to mythic you are more experienced and skilled than when you started. And you're actually ready for it as a player. 

I said 'skilled' but really it's just developing a muscle memory with your class but also mechanics in general. 

You're pretending like gear is this huge thing for progressing in PvE, it is in the sense that more numbers = better. But you need the muscle memory as a raider to beat bosses and you can't get that sending followers on missions. You seem to think you need mythic gear to do mythic. That doesn't make sense..... At all. But anyway. 
Again it basically comes down to. I don't think things that people work hard to obtain, should be obtained easily for bo reason in FarmVille. Hell, even a guy who buys a boost has earned mythic gear he gets. Because the gold he paid is a culmination of hundreds of hours of gameplay and dedication grinding gold. 

Garrison aka free loot vendor I do not support. And again.... I really don't care what others have. But I think the way they get it should be through a little bit of effort. Elitist?

I love the Garrison. I really do. 

But as many know: 

The majority of people on a forum is there to complain. 

I'm a part of minority :) So I just had to say that I'm one of those who love Garrison and it's something I would love to see forward, how profession works and how much fun I have with it all.

This is 3 weeks in. Can you do the garrison stuff for another 2 years? I don't want it removed just alternatives in place for the same bonuses. I find it pretty comical that some of the other people in this thread think there should be multiple solutions to obtaining gear. But 0 compromise on the Garrison being shoved down our throats. I strongly.... Strongly. And I mean really. Dislike the work order system. But I don't even have the matts to make my own enchants let alone sell anything? 

3k for +50 gems because of this broken prof system. Have four professions going into overdrive just to have 1 character raid ready. And I have to play this Zynga game to do it 

So how can I cut incoming matts in half? Can't. Have to do work orders.... Sigh

-------------------

I don't think 2 years ahead in time. It is foolish. 
I stay in the present. 

I'm sorry, I don't feel that I can bear to specify to you what I like about the Garrison. 
But I will say that I do really enjoy the time there and the things I can do with it. 

I only hope that they will continue to support this way of gameplay in the future because I really do like what they have done with it all.

how do you cripple yourself for proffesions and raiding without garrison ..... proffessions are still there to do , you can stil gem en enchant your gear just like you did in MoP , cata , WoTlK , TBC and vanilla. 

so you don't have to do garrisons if you find it boring , it's just a lame @ss excuse to hate on something. 

You were never one of the smart kids, I can tell...

EVERYONE STOP! 

This guy here is not enjoying Garrisons, REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELY! No no no, it does not matter if the majority are enjoying it. -This- guy does not so it must be removed AT ONCE! 

Seriously, stop trolling, and you are trolling face it you are, there is nothing wrong with Garrisons, it wont kill you to do it, and you dont need to sit inside them all day unless you want to. 

If you are serious you are still a Troll because you expect something you personally dislike to be removed. You don't like Garrisons? Tough, its a part of WoW now so go and find another game like all the other whiners who cried about pet battles being pokemon and pandaren being too silly. 

But pet battles only gives you pets... How about we make it so garrisons only give you new stuff inside your garrison, such as new looks for your buildings, stuff like that. 
As it is now, if you want to raid or do CM you need to play farmvil... Ehm, I mean garrisons. 

I'm hoping we'll get some form of addon that could make it all automatic so I don't have to sitt and sort out that boring crap every 4 hours or so. 
The guy at blizzard that came up with the idea - Fire him, please.

I know, same here. 

Admittedly, I didn't start playing on day one of the xpac, but I'm still mostly using the less optimal enchants ('Breath of...' etc.). 

I can, literally, only make one decent cloak/neck/ring enchant every 2 or 3 days. 

...and forget weapon enchants.

How about no? As you can see plenty of people enjoy Garrisons, don't like it? Leave the game. 

But you wont, you will just continue post your pointless elitist views and whine about how your forced to do a few clicks in your Garrison every day. It's part of the game now, it wont get changed, it wont be removed, and no amount of pooled tears from the minority will change that. 

So why not either adapt and have fun or find a new game or better yet just keep your pointless raging and QQing to your elitist guilds so that like minded people will soothe you.

If he said leave the game because you don't real raid, how would you feel? 

It's inconsiderate and selfish, either way.

Point is if I don't raid that does not hinder my ability to enjoy the game, this guy obviously is not having fun because of Garrisons, you don't see me crying out for 'real raids' to be removed even if I was against them. 

Why pay for something you don't enjoy? Or do they -honestly- expect posting a whine rant on the forums will get things changed? One thread by one player is going to make Blizzard scrap/alter one of the central ideas to their expansion? 

Don't think so, so why cry about it instead of finding a game you enjoy?

No not really, he can ignore the Garrison and do gear progression the traditional way, yes Garrisons are faster, by your logic though, if I enjoy solo questing and PVE then Raids are detrimental to my experience because they offer high level gear that I'd need to make my solo questing and dungeon runs faster, see how that works? 

You start saying one feature needs to be removed because it in some way influences another one and you might as well strip the game down to a single raid. The person whining here is part of the same crowd of people who were crying and stomping their feet because they had to complete 2 Battlegrounds to get their Legendary Cloak. 

Except this is even worse, because they CAN do their normal gear progression without Garrisons, they don't NEED to focus on Garrisons for their gear.

Fair enough. Like I said in the first post I just want a bypass around garrisons. I wouldn't ask for something I dislike to be removed for others. 

But I dislike it being thrown in my face. Like someone said its their fotm feature so I feel like the feature is spoon fed.

Well, they're both snobs, so both as bad as each other, in one way... 

But (IRL, at least) the first tends to have more money and/or power, or whatever and would tend to have had a better education.

In theory he can, yes. 

However, it actually really depends on how much competition there is for his raid spot. 

If he just ignores the garrison, because he dislikes it and then someone with equal skills, but far better gear, shows up - of course the RL will tend to pick that person over him. 

So, it does potentially threaten the rest of his game. 

I don't really see how that works, TBH, because even though I agree that getting better gear will help you complete questing and dungeon runs faster, it is never going to be a prerequisite for being allowed to do those activities.

So mad :O 
I'm not "elitist". What is "elit" about garrisons? And why are my views pontless and yours not? 
Looking at most of the posts both here and on the US forums garrisons are not that well liked so, yeah. 

If we could have addons that did all the boring stuff in garrisons (thats all of it) for us, that would be adepting, and I would be fine with that.

-------------------

I understand if you don't like the Garrison but you also must understand that many people love it (me included). And no, I am not a solo player, I am in a guild and run dungeons with guildies every day and we are going to run raids too. 

As I understand, garrisons is the answer to dailies, as to give you something to do besides raids and dungeons and I have to say I much much prefer it over boring dailies. 

Is it mandatory? I think yes it is, cause I already got 4 epics 645 ilvl from missions and 1 655 trinket from highmaul mission. But maybe in the first normal raid I will do I will replace half of them... Is as mandatory as dailies was in pandaria, although the people who prefer dailies instead will argue against. 

I think garrisons is great feature for lot of people. At least in my guild, most people loved garrisons. There are many things that are mandatory in wow, including dungeons and raids. You either do them and progress or you ignore some of them and you progress slower. 

Removing the part of mandatory things that you don't like is not a solution, because some people may don't like what you find fun. Would you like see it removed?

-------------------

Mute point now anyway seeing they have nerfed the requirements for professions way down to the ground.. 

JC no longer needs talasite, just bloody ore. 

Blacksmithing no longer needs ingots....just bloody ore.. 

LW no longer needs Burnished Leather, just Raw beast hide.

Aren't raids tuned for heroic blues? Any items after that are a bonus. That's how it's always worked before. 

Whilst I understand the OP's points, something is only mandatory if it prevents you from doing something else. You can progress your professions (albeit slower); you can gear up (albeit slower); you can do pretty much everything at end game (albeit slower). 

It's a (probably) 2 year expansion. What is the rush?

If he is in a guild that others see him only as a number (ilvl in this case) then this is his choice..to compete with other numbers. So he either do mandatory things to increase his number identity or he finds another guild that others see him as a person. 

Sorry, but this was the case in every MMO. There always mandatory ways to increase your ilvl...dungeons, raids, crafting, dailies... you either do them all and get the best possible number or you ignore 1 or 2 of them and you get lower number than others. This was the case in every MMO and in every wow expansion. 

Asking to remove the activities you don't like, in order to keep your number relevant with others by doing only activities you like, is not a logical request. 

Again, he should find a guild that he is judged as a person/player. If he insist to be on a guild that he is judged as a number then do what it needs to increase his number. Is really that simple, because is just a game.

It is a "bonus" but any sane raid leader takes the players with the best gear. Want a raid spot? Yeah, then it's mandatory. 
Want to raid? Cool, do 100h of worthless facebook-games first, thanks.

i am gonna assume you just started playing the game when this expansion came? as you should know thats not how it works you dont just join a guild either if your gear isnt good, as it is atm you can be just as good a player and 9 out of 10 times people still pick the bad player with the better gear especialy now when the raiding havent started yet

Wow, really? Can I come raid mythic in your guild in green leveling gear? I'm a really nice guy! Of course I can't, thats not how the world works. 

No one wants Blizzard to remove garrisons, just let players gear up using other alternatives.

-------------------

This is something wow needed. Hideout/housing part of the game. Long live Garrisons!

-------------------

Realms are up :) No need to waste precious minutes of our life writing things no one will remember in three days or less.

-------------------

To you, OP, it's mandatory. Why? Because you want to raid at an advanced level and need to get the best gear asap. However, it's just as mandatory as grinding valor points was, or gold to buy BoEs, doing raids with 10 alts for 80 hours a week (if you want worldfirsts) etc. If you want to be the best, there are things you have to do. That is perfectly fine. If you don't like one of the things you have to do in order to do what you aim for, then you can either opt to change your goal so you don't have to do that, or you can suck it up and take one for the team, so to speak. 

For people like me, it's not mandatory. I will not be raiding more then LFR and maybe, maybe a pug normal every once in a blue moon. I don't care that it will take 3 months to get my crafted gear, that other people can make a pet weeks before me, that I don't have followers of the levels needed to get a chance at raid gear, etc. 

You set a goal for yourself. In order to reach that goal, there are things you need to do. Your goal includes having to do garrisons. Do you see now that it's mandatory for 
your goal, something which 
you decided on and that 
you have control over? It's not mandatory for everyone. It's fine.

-------------------

People don't realise that Garrison's are the same old MoP daily's that no1 liked. 

In my opinion Garrioson's ruined more then it brought to the game.

-------------------

I love the garrison myself, but if you don't like it's kind of hard to get around for sure. I don't see why people would deny it, or why they keep saying the OP want the garrison removed because he so often stated that's not his intention, even in his first post alone he stated it many times. 

Now I have some good hope for you: if gearing and professions go the same way as they have always done, they'll soon be very much subpar to anything gotten through dungeons (if we get any new ones at all) and raiding. Soon the garrisons will become obsolete (for gear farming). 

I play the garrison game a lot, but I still have only one upgrade made with blacksmithing: the rest comes from running dungeons. You really do not miss as much as it seems at first, even though it's in your face all the time. You'll miss quests, stories, mounts, followers... but gear? Not that much at all. 

Hopefully that makes you feel little better, you can ignore all of it if you don't care for anything else that comes from the garrison but gear. You'll probably outlevel any gear you can make sooner than you can make it. You are only one 640 piece behind on me, the 'hardcore' garrison farmer.

-------------------

I thought garrison was going to be about building something meaningful in the game that was a creation of my own efforts just for my own enjoyment and amusement. I realised a long time ago that these things were just an end game farm, similar to Pandaria. This game suffers dreadful with this gear chasing nonsense and has for a long time funnelled players into endgame so they can do these endless, endless activities. The creators have a very narrow mind when it comes to such things. They fail to realise that players will actually keep doing something cus they enjoy it. And they also think that players are very keen to do group things like raids, guilds and dungeons so that this encourages more players to play the game. Hence a fear of giving real rewards to those that like to play solo. 

I was really hoping that I could actually build something for the fun of it. Not the case. Its again is just about numbers. Endless bloody numbers. Are your numbers better than the other player numbers. Personally I have never cared. I played this game to enjoy the bloody game. And each expansion they have taken more of the interesting content away and driven players to endgame to do this moronic stuff. Personally I liked visiting the trainer, learning my specialist skills, not having quests signposted and having stones that limit the number of portals I can create. Having stacks of twenty things made bags important and caused you to manage your activities. Having to travel all over the map to do quests, without bloody phasing, made questing interesting. And progression through levelling should take more than four days, and this is my second to 100. Sad, but the daily replaced real content when the tournament was introduced in Wrath. That was the end of Warcraft as we knew it. Gone was the Jame's Guide and in came gearscore and achievements...... 

Have fun for the next two years doing this cus being camped in Shattrath, Dalaran, Stormwind and now in your garrison sounds like its like where you are going to be living every day. Not something I will do or have ever done. 

PS I am not knocking garrisons, they are a logical extension of this game. Its just that I was hoping for something else. Would have been wonderful to have built a Dimension in Warcraft. Never mind.

To you, OP, it's mandatory. Why? Because you want to raid at an advanced level and need to get the best gear asap. However, it's just as mandatory as grinding valor points was, or gold to buy BoEs, doing raids with 10 alts for 80 hours a week (if you want worldfirsts) etc. If you want to be the best, there are things you have to do. That is perfectly fine. If you don't like one of the things you have to do in order to do what you aim for, then you can either opt to change your goal so you don't have to do that, or you can suck it up and take one for the team, so to speak. 

For people like me, it's not mandatory. I will not be raiding more then LFR and maybe, maybe a pug normal every once in a blue moon. I don't care that it will take 3 months to get my crafted gear, that other people can make a pet weeks before me, that I don't have followers of the levels needed to get a chance at raid gear, etc. 

You set a goal for yourself. In order to reach that goal, there are things you need to do. Your goal includes having to do garrisons. Do you see now that it's mandatory for 
your goal, something which 
you decided on and that 
you have control over? It's not mandatory for everyone. It's fine. 

We had 10 years without this crap, it worked well... This change was not needed.

Wow, really? Can I come raid mythic in your guild in green leveling gear? I'm a really nice guy! Of course I can't, thats not how the world works. 

We don't raid mythic because we prioritize friendship and person instead of ilvl, while I am sure many of us have the skill to do it since we play MMOs for the last decade.

...

If he is in a guild that others see him only as a number (ilvl in this case) then this is his choice..to compete with other numbers. So he either do mandatory things to increase his number identity or he finds another guild that others see him as a person. 

Sorry, but this was the case in every MMO. There always mandatory ways to increase your ilvl...dungeons, raids, crafting, dailies... you either do them all and get the best possible number or you ignore 1 or 2 of them and you get lower number than others. This was the case in every MMO and in every wow expansion. 

Asking to remove the activities you don't like, in order to keep your number relevant with others by doing only activities you like, is not a logical request. 

Again, he should find a guild that he is judged as a person/player. If he insist to be on a guild that he is judged as a number then do what it needs to increase his number. Is really that simple, because is just a game. 

i am gonna assume you just started playing the game when this expansion came? as you should know thats not how it works you dont just join a guild either if your gear isnt good, as it is atm you can be just as good a player and 9 out of 10 times people still pick the bad player with the better gear especialy now when the raiding havent started yet 

I hate to say it (and I hate when I read it) but since you assume wrong, I must say that I play since vanilla.

-------------------

The very fact that garrisons are causing this much dissent and dividing opinion to this extent means that there is something wrong with them. 

You can't please all the people, all the time, but anything that suits one group, or type, of player extremely well, while turning another group, or type, of player off the game almost entirely, is failing to meet its brief, to one degree or another. 

Because the game is supposed to seem enjoyable, or at least bearable, to as many people as possible. 

The same could have been said about (for example) raiding, pre-LFR. 

Some people loved it, loved the elitism of "real raiding", loved the prestige, loved the exclusiveness; but, other people (understandably) loathed it, so they introduced an alternative, a middle ground. 

That's not to say garrisons are entirely wrong, or should be scrapped (just as "real" raiding wasn't scrapped in favour of LFR), but it's obvious they need to be looked at, again. 

Either that, or they need to give us some equal choices.

-------------------

The OP has a point . 

Also those who want a mobile APP prove him right , its gives to much advantage its not optional its mandatory , profession , bonus seals , bonus raid drops as items or legendary quest items . 
ETC ETC . 

I used to log do a few missions , let some longer for the night and get over it . 

But here it comes the change , my brother got to 100 a week later , he goes to school (i work) so he could spam missions more time during the day , he reached and surpassed me quickly . 

I even once logged in the morning to restart missions before work ! (never did turn pc on in years in the morning) 
I didnt ask my brother to spam missions for me cos he got 1 character i play 3 , just enter each hour all of them and spam missions for 10 15 minutes open crates and repeat is annoying . 

Its like those FB games , farmvile etc , theyre addicting and i dont rlly like them to be honest . Garrisons are fun and nice , and everything , but those missions .... 

The solutions could be : NEVER ever do an app that would be a breaking point . Or just cap missions a week , like 70-100 missions a week , so everyone can take theyre time doing it , and not fal behind . 

they capped materials/professions everything which prevents someone not to grind and maxx out in 1 2 days . Which blocks progression giving time for everyone , same could be done here . Not so great but it works . 

Or duno make the mission time increase each new mission and reset once a week . so each mission takes longer and longer . 

I know it sound punishing , but really i think its bad design . 

Last mission i did was yesterday evening , and the next i will do will be today in the evening , meanwhile someone did 10X that amount , and i dont want to wake up at night to reschedule them (did that when was young in EVE with theyre skillqueue) i dont want get into wow in early morning and setup a remote viewer for it .

We do not like the same things, you verbaly abuse me and that makes your point of view right?

The quality of pro-garrison mouthbreathers is extremely entertaining.

after this point, anything youve said in the thread becomes irrelevant, because you arent responding to the op, just giving your own opinions on what you think and feel....you obviously have no idea what the op is trying to convey, and show a very childish attitude....so you stating you are very likely older than him - doesnt really throw a good light on you. 

the garrisons ARE pretty much required for crafting...its that simple. 
there are no alternatives, and the boost they give make them too competitive to not have....hence "mandatory" 

if you cant understand that, even without the ops - OP, then you really dont understand the mechanics behind THIS part of the game.

-------------------

I don't like garrisons either but since i play supercasual and it's not that important aspect of game I don't really mind it being in game. I only wish blizz guys cared more about class balance, pvp and quality of content they are pushing on live realms.

It seemed so good at first though... Garrisons sounded like a bad-!@# version of Wildstars housing, all the old "bad guys" coming back, removing all the useless spells and streamlining it all. 
Turns out garrisons are as the OP said - FarmVille 1.1, the bad guys are indeed back but they the spells removed where not only the useless ones and half my mounts have no use anymore *crying*

You don't need to do anything in your Garrison to do LFR. Carry on

-------------------

So you don't like the garrison, OK. I would argue though that it is too grindy. I found it to be less grindy than for example doing daily quests for reputation, killing mobs for reputation and gathering. These things used to be a big part of the game, now I don't have to do them to get the most out of the game and I don't mind. 

I'm afraid the garrisons will be boring too after a while but for now I enjoy them. At least this is a new way to do grindy stuff. I don't think it is ever possible to include non-grindy stuff that lasts for long enough, and the alternative would be more daily quests and more mobs to kill and other repetitive things that this genre is really about. I hate those so I'm happy with the garrisons, and if it didn't provide the current benefits then it would just be another thing you can do besides having to do the daily quests and farming. Also it brings back some Warcraft memories so all in all I consider it a win.

-------------------

I dont understand what is actually so grindy about garrisons? It takes really a few clicks to do the stuff there. They are much more lightweight in time investment than the dull and bleak pandaria dailies. 

Your other point about signle player orientedness is also strange. Most of WoW casual friendly content including dungeons bg skirmishes lfr is single player oriented. You only need a group if you seek for some achievements or looking for socializing. Again I don't see the problem here.

So you have now posted 3 times without actually reading the OP. 

Hold now just because, a Person does not agree with you. 
Or writes something you find silly? Does not mean they did not read it. 

I can tell you I don't find Garrisons much forced. 
I barely even picked my Buildings based around what I would ''need'' 

I find it very optimal(insert kappa face) as you can even replace Buildings at will! 

And that is all I have to say to this post that I did read.

-------------------

There's nothing wrong with having Garrisons, just don't concentrate most of the gameplay in there. 

Daily quests 
Daily crafting 
Daily gathering 
Bank and AH 
Primal trader 

Whatever you do, you always return to your Garrison. Very often. Most of the content is tied to it (Frostwall Tavern. Stables etc) 

And that's not really the problem. The problem is that you're alone in your Garrison. It doesn't feel like you have the option to play it in a different way. It feels like there's no diversity and a serious lack of content for level 100. 

The hubs like Shattrath or Dalaran were epic. They turned into the Garrison, which is epicly smaller, void of players and with a daily progress limit. 

Warspear should be the hub, but it's really small, isolated and it offers portals and things that you use once a month, or just once. 

Overall I see too many barriers / too much control over the player's time and activities. 

It's epic from a graphical PoV, kudos to the artists and designers, but content-wise, it's just the foundation.

-------------------

I'm disappointed that my lvl 3 barracks aren't giving me ranged pandaren guards. My ranged are stil dwarf riflemen. What's up with that really? 

What bugs me about garrisons overall is the feeling that it's not really <mine>. I'm just in charge, but that's pretty much it. I don't even have my personal quarters.

You missed the bit were he admitted to not reading it several times?... Or? But I could tell since he was making arguments that had nothing to do with what I said so yeh. There's that. 

I'm very perceptive or something

-------------------

I don't like garrisons too much either: 

No visual customization (=> impersonal feeling)
Takes away the MMO in MMORPG (who'll be visiting the cities once everyone has his own AH?)
Too connected with outside world gameplay (cf. professions)

It's fine while leveling because it's quite well integrated with the story and leveling experience, but it shouldn't play such a central role in the game overall. Especially not at max level. 

But that's just my opinion. Everyone's entitled to one :)

-------------------

I made a thread earlier about the lack of content so far in this expansion, because Garrisons is the feature that pretty much took away more content/new race or classes etc. Also the design for most classes are a joke, a lot of abilities were removed and such and I think the reason why other measures of the game seem to lack depth, is because of the Garrisons.

-------------------

I love garrisons.... i hate LFG/LFR so its each to there own.

-------------------

I like my garrison, I actually like it a lot more than I thought I would. 

Not liking part of the game doesn't necessarily mean it's bad game design, people just have different preferences, can't please them all. 

I don't really understand the 'it's mandatory' thing. What exactly do you really need to do with garrisons to PVP or raid or whatever? 

You might say it really cripples your professions but it takes 5 mins a day to mine/herb and set some work orders going. Do you really hate it so much you can't spend 5 mins there? 

Hell right now I can set enough work orders at my JC building that I could leave it for more than 4 days before i'd have to go back. Is that really evidence of something that's 'super grindy'?

Pretty sure I am not alone when I say that is precisely the problem. I guess for players who wish to do nothing but raid or pvp just simply clicking a few work order cooldowns every few hours is a dream come true, but for those players whose main playtime revolved around alting, professions and gathering/farming etc, a whole avenue of gameplay has just been as good as removed. 

I don't hate the garrison, I can see the appeal, things like the Glad Sanctum and Stables, upgrades etc are actually quite fun, I just upgraded some of my stuff today and have enjoyed it! But for anyone remotely interested in spending time on professions, it's not really much fun at all to have nothing to do but wait to click cooldown buttons on work orders and have pretty much everything gated behind that.

And this is part of the problem. It's so "good" that skipping it puts you so far behind that it's not even funny. It gives you professions, gear, everything and too much of it. 
It's a FarmVille ripoff that every players needs to do if they want to do anything beyond LFR or petbattles (You might even need it for PB) - That right there is bad design.

-------------------

I'm someone who enjoys the gameplay of Garrisons quite a lot, but I agree wholeheartedly with the overall sentiment of the OP. Garrisons have been made far too integral a part of WoD, to the extent that they've overshadowed everything else, and I feel really bad for the people who aren't fond of them. 

From the start Garrisons should have more closely resembled the player housing feature they were billed as; more about cosmetic customisation and a few cool optional activities to enjoy, rather than an integral nexus for character progression. 

Garrisons are a really cool part of the game, and an addition that I like a lot. Their massive impact on gameplay, however, isn't. 
It's been proven time and time again in WoW that railroading millions of players into the same activity just isn't a great way to make such a diverse playerbase happy. Options and alternatives are what keep games like WoW healthy and engaging.

-------------------

Garrisons should be a perk, but there is too many cool rewards from them and they also double your professions that makes them pretty mandatory, and if you don't do them feel like you're missing out. 

I'm pretty neutral to garrisons.

-------------------

YOU SAVED ME OP.REALLY.THANK YOU. 
Sorry for a personal story post but just my 2 cents if anyone is interested. 

I started wow 2 months before WotLK and played all the way until Cata came.Then I realized what I have become and changed my life around quiting wow. 

5 months ago I passed some exams and wanted to see my old char.I bought MoP and went through it in 1 month.I thought it was awesome (not realizing that I blazed through content in 1 month and people are stuck with it for 2 years).I paused again because of the exams and started playing 2 months ago.I finished everything in WoW in the month before WoD (Loremaster, many rep etc) and I was so hyped to play though an expansion fully like WotLK. 

I pre ordered WoD, I got the Dread Raven too and even race changed my boosted guy since I hated the race I picked.And then it comes. 

3 days of problems.3 days of doing all quests.3 days of getting all gear, treasures and rares. 

2 weeks realizing all you posted, how this is just a scam to keep you playing.I wanted to quit a couple of times but each day my little farm changed my mind because of "all the rewards". 

Thank you for all these posts.WoW is an addiction and now even more so.I spend so much time on this !@#$.I quit once and I will quit again.I have 2 more days + 5 bonus but %^-* that.Thank you so much for all these forum posts, you saved me from this drug. 

THANKS AGAIN.

-------------------

I'm enjoying the garrison a lot although the prospect of doing it over again on all of my alts isn't really something that seems all that appealing to me. They are fun but time consuming at first and also they are expensive to fully upgrade for somebody that isn't all that great at making gold.

-------------------

I'm really dissapointed with this expansion so far, this has been the second expansion in a row where the first initial patch has been boring as hell. 

Mists tried to get me to do 30 dailies a day, yeah gee that was fun. 

Now WoD is making me send followers on really fun sounding missions but I just sit here and wait for them to get back. I HAVE LITERALLY BECOME A QUEST GIVER! sucks.

Off-topic: And i tought MoP was a bad expansion. 

I never tought that there will be an expansion like WoD to challenge Cataclysm. 
The hidden reason is because WoW is running away from its initial RPG approach more and more with each expansion. 

Garrisons are just a more obvious representation of that direction, here farmville-like activities. 

Garrisons could really have been something else. A missed opportunity. 

I feel that the development spent so much time on that feature that if felt compelled to make it involved deeper in other playstyles, betraying then its initial "totally optional" trait.

-------------------

What really pisses me off is the absurd number of mascots, toys & mounts as rewards for quests / rep. 

I think that this shouldn't be such a huge part of the game. 

I was told I would fight some kick-!@#-orcs not looting toys & pokemon all over their lands...

-------------------

So much in WOD smells like Wildstar to me. I have this feeling they rehired the coders and developers who went to Wildstar bk then, and put them in charge of WOD. As one who loves doing achieves: still seing the bug in the achieve panel that says u dont have an achieve on this or that char for 3 months now since I came bk from Wildstar that was and is filled with bugs is highly frustrating. 
All there is to do for many is achieves now and this is a MAJOR bug because we cant verify on armory anymore either pr char wise. This just seems to be left out for so long its driving me and many others away slowly. 
And I will never learn to like Garrisons. I wish they will remove it and especially the followers (wow is not mopa nor is it pokemon)again for gd or make it a guild hub only. 
The zones and visuals looks awsome, they put a low of work into that and atm its the only thing that keeps me playing because I havent seen everything yet. 

Working my !@# off for CMs has quickly gone away for me after seing guilds sell boosts alr, it should be banable, the same way selling and buying gold is. Having rich noobs run around with those weapons is a disgrace to the achieve system and to the ppl who did this the proper way. 
And since many cant raid end content as 10man any anymore that road wont be sailed for us and many other casual/small social guilds this time, so all we have left is achieves and pvp and farming this or that. But when things dont work, and the things that do work is the slave job, we are left with nothing. 

What happened to this world

-------------------

I honestly don't understand the human race.... 
Everyone is so angry about everything, negative and generally not very constructive. 

You say it is crippling you - because it takes you 15 days, and someone who did put the effort in 7.5 days... 
I'm sorry but has it not always been like this in... EVERYTHING in life...? 
Except here you still can reach the same goal - it just takes you longer time. 

It's not a matter of, as you said it "Walk barefoot over a mountain for 365 days", vs instant gratification.... 
It is a matter of one person putting effort into something, and you not doing so... 

YOU might not find it funny, and that's fine. 
I know plenty of people who don't find Pet Battling funny, and I also find myself angry at it when dealing with the Mangerine bosses who requires a certain type of pet - which I might not have bothered to level. 
The key is right there - BOTHERED.... 
I can level said pet and then battle said boss, it will just take me longer time cause I didn't do it before. 
I don't get up in a hissyfit because of that? 

I enjoy this expansion, so extremely much, and the things I feel like I am at a disadvantage at - I blame on no one but myself... because honestly, not leveling that pet isn't blizzards fault! 
I am very tired of the "Me me me" and "My way" attitude that people seem to adopt more and more... 
I log on any toon and instantly have to switch off Trade / General cause people are so eager to complain, to hate and to just rip at everything that does not fit their feets. 

I get it. 
You do not like Garrisons. 
That's fine... 
You really do not have to do Garrisons, it's true! - You don't!! 
It gives BONUSES. 
Not MANDATORY things. 
If you do not wish to have those bonuses - then yey, no garrison for you! 
If you wish to have said bonuses - I am sorry but what do you expect the world to do for you, all the time adapt everything to whatever you feel is better? 

Let us see. 
I can't handle people very well due to attitudes and whatnot that I just, honestly, get depressed to witness.... 
... I suppose everyone should be forced into some sort of camp and be trained to behave better! 
Yey, life is enjoyable again! 
- I'm sorry to say but this is not how life works. 
We all have issues with things, we all like different things, we all dislike different things. 
What blizzard has provided here ---IS---- optional!!!! 
No matter how much crazy Me-negativity you wish to apply to it, you CHOOSE to get 2 of X everyday, or 1. 
It 
is 
not 
mandatory. 

You can still raid perfectly fine. 
You can still pvp more than well! 
You can pet battle your heart out! 
You do not need any of the mounts, toys if you don't find these funny.

Proffessions --- Again I repeat: Bonus or no bonus, your choice, neither is mandatory. 
Please 
for the love of Raptor Thrall... 
Stop the negativity, everyone. 
And if you still hate it so godawfully much and claim it is mandatory, perhaps YOU have just missed the entire point and it is YOU who should .. oh I don't know... do something else?? 

Please, and thank you.

WoW more than ever, has turned into a lobby game for me. I sit in my 
garrison waiting for queues to pop. Every now and then I get the ding that 
tells me its time to send the followers back out. I do not enjoy 
garrisons. I do them because I feel I need to to keep pace with my 
professions.Garrisons are Farmville, there is no escaping that. I 
detest Farmville.I started in Wrath. I have never felt this bored 
so early into an expansion. I'm meant to start raiding with my guild next 
week (peeps off this week so couldn't start) and you know, I'm really not 
sure If I can be bothered.

You say it is crippling you - because it takes you 15 days, and someone 
who did put the effort in 7.5 days...I'm sorry but has it not always 
been like this in... EVERYTHING in life...?Except here you still can 
reach the same goal - it just takes you longer time.

That's the OP's whole point. You don't have to do it, but you cripple 
yourself by not doing it. It takes longer. Twice as long.

-------------------

Can people please go back to school and learn how to read? 

OP never said that he/she wanted the Garrison removed. OP simply said that he/she wanted Blizzard to give us other options outside of the garrison to gear up. 

Don't understand how it can be that pages after pages in this thread is full of people that obviously can't read through text. 

What are they teaching you kids in school these days? 

Reading is obviously not it. 

Also I emphatize with people that love Garrisons since it actually gives them something to do at "endgame" other then just stand around, waiting for weekly queues in city hubs. 

However I don't really think that Garrisons solved this issue.' 

After 10 years Blizzard still haven't solved the "stand around waiting for queue issue". 

WoW have been a UI game for a long time where you do everything through menues. A game where there is nothing to do when you are locked out from your weekly activities. 
Now it's a facebook game as well which I guess was and idea to bandaid the fact that there is nothing to do most of the wek but the problem is that it didn't actually fix the problem. 

That's unfortunately what happens when you make your whole game revolve around endgame and make it so easy for everyone to get there; people become bored.

You've got the same way to gear up as always. Dungeons, raids, PvP and AH BoE's. Garrisons are an "extra way". Don't like it? Then use the other tried and tested ways. 

After 10 years Blizzard still haven't solved the "stand around waiting for queue issue". 

What queues did you stand in during vanilla, tbc and the first part of wrath?

What queues did you stand in during vanilla, tbc and the first part of wrath? 

You are very correct on this point. During early WoW we didn't have any queues to sit and wait in because there was no LFD feature. 

HOWEVER if it was one thing we did during Wrath and BC it was standing around in Dalaran or Shattrath, waiting for invites from people spamming /trade. 

YES WE WERE STANDING AROUND WAITING EVEN IN 2008! 

Again! This is what happens when you make your whole game revolve around endgame instead of the journey. 

World of Warcraft in modern day have a definitive end which is when you are done with levelling. The issue is that there is nothing in place to solve this in PvE outside of raids. When you are locked out of your weekly's then you are done playing for that week. 

World of Warcraft is a great game that's not what I'm saying here. Even after 10 years i'd consider it my third best MMORPG of all time and I like others have enjoyed levelling numerous of characters to max level. 

However the issue still stands; Blizzard have just no way to keep peoples interest at max level and especially after how burnt out people was during the Endless Siege of Orgrimmar you'd thought they had systems in place in Warlords of Draenor to combat this and keep ppls interest (subs) throughout the timespan of the expac. 

Unfortunately looking at Warlords of Draenors current state it looks like Blizzard already have hit that brick wall that they ran into during Pandaria. 
The worst is that we are in the start of the new expac but gameplay wise we are already back to where we left off during the Endless Siege of Orgrimmar; burnt out, bored and unwilling to keep on paying our subs because there is nothing to do. 

For us it's a good thing cause we are saving money. For Blizzard it's a disaster because they lose countless of money from their poor design choices.

And I don't like the Garrisons™ 

this

-------------------

Funny how many people are saying "don't use them then" as an argument for sub-optimal game play. How can that argument be valid when the "You can use a ground mount if I can fly" is so universally derided? Both involve gimping yourself to absurd levels that just don't make sense in terms of character progression. 

Garrisons are as optional as raiding, levelling, professions and talent specs. You can log in and do things within the game without doing any of them, but they make up the majority of the game. 

+1 for the OP, and the responses from people who don't read it fully are hilarious.

03/12/2014 18:10Posted by f50f3dcba114187a

Pretty sure I am not alone when I say that is precisely the problem. I 
guess for players who wish to do nothing but raid or pvp just simply 
clicking a few work order cooldowns every few hours is a dream come 
true, but for those players whose main playtime revolved around alting, 
professions and gathering/farming etc, a whole avenue of gameplay has 
just been as good as removed.

So now it's both too grindy AND too quick and easy it removes something 
from people that want to go out grinding?

04/12/2014 00:50Posted by 2d165465644b525e

It's so "good" that skipping it puts you so far behind that it's not 
even funny. It gives you professions, gear, everything and too much of 
it.It's a FarmVille ripoff that every players needs to do if they 
want to do anything beyond LFR or petbattles (You might even need it for 
PB) - That right there is bad design.

You can skip it if you want, just buy the crafted stuff on the AH instead. 
That's the alternative. The gear won't be an issue in a few weeks when 
people have a few raid drops, HC raiding gear is better than double 
upgraded profession stuff anyway. Enchant/gem prices will come down soon 
as well and then you can just buy them from the AH if you really hate the 
garrison so much.Or you can do the absolute minimum to aid your 
professions by simply spending 5 mins a day there getting the ore and 
herbs and setting work orders going. Once a day you go there for literally 
5 mins and that is enough to get the bonus stuff for your professions. 
Again, a lot of the profession stuff will be a lot cheaper in the coming 
weeks anyway or in the case of the gear completely pointless once you have 
some pieces from raids.

I have never said it was grindy. Personally I don't see what is so grindy about logging on for a couple of minutes clicking a couple of bits and logging off, I can't vouch for how others feel however. 

But yes - when you said it removes something from people who used to spend most of their playtime farming - yes, it does. The need or desire to spend anywhere near as much time online, for a start. Fairly sure less time online is not what Blizzard wants from paying subscribers. 

What I meant was, there are people (like me) who were 
not chasing the next raid or PvP tier, who enjoyed being out in the world, who appreciated the depth of professions within the game and whose playstyle revolved around alting and professions, spending hours happily farming for cloth or shards or herbs, skilling up their stuff etc. Sure, we can go out and herb and mine etc - but what's the point when it is literally worthless now, both in gold and appreciation terms? 

I've tried to keep it as brief as possible, hope it makes sense.

It does and I do see your point. I kind of like having the stuff there in 
the garrison, but then I liked the farm in MoP and had several I did

I also started back in Wrath, and I would frankly prefer to get on my horse and go out farming stuff the old way rather than having it handed to me on a plate stuck only behind a wall of timed work orders, therefore I do think your comment (if it's meant to be a dig at "Wrath Babies") is a tad unfair. If it wasn't a dig, then I'm sorry I mis-read your comment.

I like Garrisons. 

Do I then have the "wrong" opinion about it?

Also I have mining and herb on my main, It's how I have always made my gold as Im not into all that playing the auction house for hours. Garrisons has completely killed my proffesions and gold making by giving EVERYONE access to a load of ore and herbs a day :C

That's not a queue though. And you didn't have to do that, like you don't have to now either. You have the ability whisper people while your out in the world adventuring.......

This sounds like the same old "There are multiple ways to get good gear, to play optimally I have to use all of them, remove all the ways I don't enjoy so my way of playing becomes the optimal one" rant that we see in every expansion. 

I don't enjoy PvP, it sucks that PvP can provide equipment useful for PvE content, clearly I'm forced to do PvP if I want to be optimal. I'm not saying that PvP should be removed, but atleast it shouldn't provide any high level equipment, perhaps just some transmog sets and/or a mount. Sounds legit?

Don't know about the legendary quest - but it is after all a legendary quest. Is it linked to professions?

No. You literally need the BoP items to even level to profession. Please, teach me how to level engineering without gear-spring parts. A BoE item should be craftable in the same time with a garrison as it is without. Or else the bonus from the Garrison should only be 20-30%.

I don't like that every path in the game goes through the Garrison. It's unavoidable since it's a boost to literally every activity in the game. If you enjoy that activity, you need a garrison.

-------------------

Agreed 100% make them optional, the damn things are so boring and repetitive.

-------------------

While initially, I agreed with 664fb7ffb7ad448d et al about this, the more I think about it, the more I cant shake the feeling that his argument is basically the same one that is used to support the Flying Ban. 

"Yes, I can travel on a ground mount, I can gather materials, and explore, but, if there are flying mounts in the game I HAVE to use them to be competitive !! Therefore, Ground mounts are not an option !!" 

Its the exact same argument, just with different subject matter. 

There is nothing that I can see (after some of the breadcrumb quests for leveling) that is locked out by not using the Garrison (obviously discounting Garrison Specific features like followers etc.). 

The gear that garrison missions can provide can also be obtained from the Raids, it just takes longer without the garrison. 
The Profession materials can be obtained without the Garrison, it just takes longer without it. 
The Garrison invasions can drop items and mounts, but all of those can be obtained out in the world too. It just takes longer without the garrison. 

There are Garrison Specific achieve and stuff, but, if you are not interested in the Garrison or Achievements then its not required. In Fact, the Garrison/Follower content and achievements are about the ONLY element of the garrison that actually CAN NOT be accessed without the Garrison. 

If you hate it that much, simply do not do it. I feel the same way about PvP content. Hate it. Dont do it. Dont cry about not getting the rewards that can come from it. 

But thats just how I am. If I am unwilling to do a thing, I stop thinking about what I might be able to get for doing it (or how quickly I could get it) if I WAS willing to do it.

-------------------

Look at me, I hate Tetris!

-------------------

Are you... super mario?

-------------------

My main problem with the garrisons came with the mission rewards. Never 
before has an aspect in this game has an as appalling effect on me as 
garrisons had once I realized that. Not only do I have to log on to set 
the missions as often as possible, but it is an aspect of the game that 
really doesn't interest me.To put it into perspective, a co-raider 
in my raid team reached 680 ilvl when I had 671 just solely because of 
garrisons. 4 mythic rewards, including a trinket from the end boss which 
we haven't even killed. Utterly disgraceful.

"Yes, I can travel on a ground mount, I can gather materials, and 
explore, but, if there are flying mounts in the game I HAVE to use them 
to be competitive !! Therefore, Ground mounts are not an option !!"Its 
the exact same argument, just with different subject matter.

Except there is nobody who's gonna stop you and say: "you're moving X% 
slower than the other mounted people. Since you have put in so little 
effort to move fast, I'm going to have to bench you.". That is however a 
very legitimate scenario for raiders. Missing out on garrison loot is not 
an option for progression raiders.

02/02/2015 13:41Posted by 359312dec5fefcca

The gear that garrison missions can provide can also be obtained from 
the Raids, it just takes longer without the garrison.

And that is the exact point. Some people play X part of the game because 
they enjoy it, and only it. Having to dabble in Y part of the game as a 
part of doing your best at X part is ... Awkward.

That means this doesn't apply to you. If you'd be willing to stop doing 
garrisons because you dislike them, you're probably not one of the people 
raiding in any kind of progression that requires it.

-------------------

If they had absolutely nothing to do with professions and did not have chat channels that allow people to sit in them all day, i.e. purely novelty for fun and not necessary for gameplay then they might have been enjoyable.

-------------------

I like it, I just think it's too time consuming and too many rewards are given at the same time. A FreeToPlay Browsergame does exactly that, get up at night to do missions or get owned by your neighbour who does. From WoW, a Game I pay for, I expect better mechanics.

-------------------

Actually... there is so much utter truth in this complaint: 

Garrisons are great. They could even be fun. If they were optional. 

The whole thing of "but players must be told to do garisons and fight over events in ashran" concept. The whole attitude is that of a bad Gamemaster in Tabletop RPGs: Trying to force the players into what THEY want... instead of creating a world full of contrasts, imbalances, problems, challenges and see what the players make of it. And yes... that is freedom... totally scary, right?

You are entirely correct, I do not now, nor ever have in the past, taken part in any activity that would attempt to force me into doing something that I do not want to do. 

I'm happy to try a thing to see if I will do it as a "thing" but if I find it distasteful or onerous I will happily walk away from it and anything else that requires it. Its called willpower. It allows me to deny myself something I might enjoy if that thing comes with unacceptable Strings Attached. 

My advice to you all would be to find a raid group that doesnt try to force its people into doing things that they do not enjoy. Peer Pressure of that type is destructive.

EVERYONE STOP! 

This guy here is not enjoying Garrisons, REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELY! No no no, it does not matter if the majority are enjoying it. -This- guy does not so it must be removed AT ONCE! 

Seriously, stop trolling, and you are trolling face it you are, there is nothing wrong with Garrisons, it wont kill you to do it, and you dont need to sit inside them all day unless you want to. 

If you are serious you are still a Troll because you expect something you personally dislike to be removed. You don't like Garrisons? Tough, its a part of WoW now so go and find another game like all the other whiners who cried about pet battles being pokemon and pandaren being too silly. 

Yeah, and some of us actually left and took our money with us.

the same arguments come every expansion - in cata it was "i need to do lfr to play optimally" . in mop it was

some people just dont know when to say themselves when to stop - its their own greed fault not one of game. 

i do agree though that missions should never reward mythic gear - hc possibly yes as supplement but not mythic especially not from bosses that u didnt kill - it was pretty ridiculous when my monk got loot from last 2 bosses on mythic which i will never kill when this tier will be current :)

-------------------

I do agree that people should be able to choose a room in some Tavern / Inn to be their living quarters and maybe get special reputation with some people in the city, so they get the same benefits as the garrison lovers. Just they be running around in the city instead. 

Raiders have always (or at least before it was a game filled with whiny children) been farming something for 5 hours a day, just to raid 2 nights a week. 
Garrisons just reduce the amount of time you are farming. Making bots less needed. 
There were so much farming requirement time, that people felt the need to use a bot, because they didn't have time to play that many hours a day, that this game required. 

Then there was daily quests to make us even more sticky to the game every day. 
That changed to weekly quests, and you could do them more times a day. so now you could log in 1 or 2 days a week instead of every day, and still keep up. But this disappeared again. 

Garrisons work orders is kinda similar. You can log in every 3. day or so, instead of daily. You will miss out on some resources, but then you can just have a farm character, like in the old days and still get more materials now, than you ever could before( without a bot) 

One said that his m8 got ilvl 680 because of garrison missions. Well that is not because of the high ilvl gear, but because his low ilvl gear got switched. You can in fact still get the same gear from other places, if you are a raider. just give it a few more weeks, just like in the old days. oh w8, back then you could go for a year, and still not get your items, while some of your fellow raiders got them all in 2 months or so. 

What has changed with garrisons. Casual and solo players can still get gear. 
Your spend less time farming (in this otherwise farmville game) 
bots are less likely to occur. 
you have to go to another place than your main working location to be social(oh w8, we always did that), or you have to be in a party/raid. 

daily quests are still here, just as before garrisons. Not sure if they are important. 

I would like to be able to open ones garrison to friends and guild members. without being in a party or even being logged in. 

Professions: 
Stop whining, you are not really playing the garrison game, if you just head down to your profession buildings and right click the crates and them click on a person there, ask him the do 21 more f those, then leave. 
voila you now have speed up your professions material production. 

So yes there could be done more for the garrisons, but take it slow and see what happens, is a good thing. maybe some of our ideas for garrisons and alternatives, will be implemented later, when this is more stable. 
Maybe they make guild garrisons and maybe they will be unstable / unbalanced. and maybe still will have too much work required or maybe they will have too little for us to do. 
Maybe it depends on how many is in the guild and how many hours they have each. 

Maybe it is hard to target both players who play 12 hours a day and players who plays 8 hours a week.

-------------------

Guys, wow is becoming more and more farmville and whatever other crap you think of, because the game is not what it used to be anymore, times change and wow changes, the game is living just because of it's former glory and fame, even I play it still just because of old memories (vanilla/tbc/wotlk - rest after that is pure !@#$). I mean just look what they introduce in 6.1, twitter, selfie cameras etc... god knows what they will introduce in the future in next expansions... its becoming worse and worse...

-------------------

I'll probably get shot down for this - but I was wondering why WoW has no gay characters? Gays play the game too, and it's the 21st Century and all. 

A lot of young people play the game, and it'd make a good impression, and help people be more accepting in everyday life. 

Yes, I'm gay, and don't really care about the homophobes, but think WoW would be doing themselves a service if they implemented a character into the game which is gay.

-------------------

boy you on drugs ?

-------------------

Apart from those prescribed by my GP, um, no I'm not. And don't really get your reason for asking about my drug habits, or what it's got to do with the subject I'm choosing to discuss.

-------------------

I just hope that if they do decide to add a gay character then it'll be done tastefully and respectfully. We need more gay characters in mainstream games who just happen to be gay instead of being a walking parody.

-------------------

I think some are gay they just don't come right out and say it. 
Anduin for example

Yes, exactly. Make them gay, and it accepted by other NPCs or even not discussed by other NPCs, and that'll make a good example. 

Some games are implimenting gay characters into their games, some better than others.

Of course. 
If Blizzard decides to, it should not be the main focus of the character/quest/etc.

-------------------

I think it's purely a case of being totally ambiguous about sexual orientation for most of the characters simply because that doesn't matter to the stories they want to tell. Apart from the few obvious examples (Jaina and Arthas being the prime one), I can't think of a time when Warcraft world has ever been utterly specific about any sexual orientation no matter what way it is. I agree it would set a good example, and was pleased to see there are two female characters in the Pandarian Shrine (Alliance at least) with the same surname (Stockton) doing the /shy and /flirt emotes at each other. One is a Dwarf and the other is Human, so obviously not sisters. I think Blizzard can just get on with telling the grand stories about dragons and futuristic space goats without getting bogged down by making a point just for the sake of it :)

-------------------

Because there's no need for sexuality to be in the game at all.

-------------------

How do you know there are not any gay characters, sexuality of most people in this game is unkown, with only a few assumed, such as Varyn because he has a son, even then he still could be gay, we just don't know. The only one we can say with some clarity is Thrall, because we see him get married. But then, he still could be bisexual, we don't know! 

Why does it even matter?! As you said, this is the 21st Centrury, we don't need to keep creating character to fit into whatever group of people feel unrepresentened, and force them into storylines to appease them.

Just for the simple fact - it simply doesn't matter. 

It's natural to man to love woman and woman to love man. If people are the other way inclined thats completely up to them and I'm not one to judge, but why should Blizzard go to an effort just to show they support gays? I just don't think they care lol! 

Plus, you don't know the sexuality of every character. Garrosh could be gay. :)

-------------------

While it would be pretty cool if blizzard tastefully added openly-gay characters, I don't really see it as a huge deal and something they -must- do. Generally relationships aren't a major thing in this game, at least outside of a couple of storylines in the past, and so it wouldn't really be that relevant to the current story. 

Having a quest-giver mention their partner in passing though, and that partner just happening to be of the same gender, could work well.

And in a fantasy world, gay people are too 'real'? What do you mean by that? 

I really don't understand the 'we don't need diversity' argument. It won't affect you if it's not something in-your-face, and it can be interesting for those who'd like to see someone who feels the same way they do, or can be refreshing that it's not made into such a different thing or a big deal.

There are ways to indirectly mention sexuality without just randomly blurting it out. As in the example I gave, a quest-giver could tell you to go save his partner who's been taken by saberon. Upon saving them, you realise the partner is infact of the same gender as the quest-giver. 

Even something like that though would likely get the game banned in Russia and probably a few other countries, so Blizzard will probably never do it.

Stop forcing it, great that you are that way but we dont have to have it in every game and show just for the sake of it to be PC.

Exactly, why add one? Unless a characters sexual orientation serves to further the storyline in some way, then it just feels tacked on and cheap thus making it a waste of time.

-------------------

This is a fantasy world. Leave sexuality out of that. 
I do not care what you are nor what you do in real life, nor do I care about your sexual orientation. I do not want the game to turn into that direction, as simple as that. 
Let it be a fantasy game as it already is, we have no need for this here at all. 
Gay population is already over-commercialized in many countries, I don't want to have that in game too.

-------------------

sexuality may not matter but we have had several straight couples under the spotlight... why not simply adding a few of the same gender? 

<Nevermind, it is better not to discuss this topic on the forums.> 

first of all we are not in north korea and since these are the european boards i would invite you to speak openly and save the doubts for topics regarding mafia and other illegal activities which definitely don't fit a videogame's message board. 

the real controversial thing here is the fact that !@#$-sexuality at the end of 2014 is considered "not to be discussed on the forums" and that some user like you may feel uncomfortable enough to decide to withdraw their previous post. 

videogames as massive as wow could totally move the decency forward but i guess there's too much to lose in saying "f-- you ________ (insert name of homophobic country's government here)" because companies are not humanitarian associations after all and it's not up to them to raise the tolerance bar higher and/or giving lessons to people. 

the funny thing is... videogames as massive as wow are totally capable to influence the pop culture (some already did) and we all know that a pop phenomena reaches many more people than some humanitarian plead. 

if wow ever became controversial because of gay characters... how stupid would that be? the main plot in this game is taking part in a war and slaughter the enemies and despising them also because they belong to another race. i see PLENTY of horrible things that this game potentially is teaching to the younger generations (be the strongest, kill your enemies, never trust a member of another race) but the reason why this game is doing great (beyond the technical features like pvp, raids and dungeons) is the fact that the plot has been wonderfully written and many characters show true emotional depth and weaknesses and in some case they do teach lessons of humanity, plus the company itself respects any kind of differences when it comes to its employees so i am sure, and i wait, that a moment will come when they introduce gay characters, maybe silently, maybe without any announcement and that'd be the greatest victory because if something is normal doesn't have to be greatly shown off... or maybe they even did already and we didn't even notice. 

ps - ROFL "h-o-m-o-s-e-x-u-a-l-i-t-y" is censored. really?

"Okay guys its time to attack this iron horde, oh by the way i'm gay"

-------------------

Thrall would have made for a badass !@#$. 

Of course Blizzard didn't have the guts for that. 

But then I wouldn't see the point in having a gay character simply because sexual orientation wouldn't be relevant at all here. 

The only way they could reasonably do it is if it were a sidenote, like a questgiver who just so happens to have a housemate of the same gender. Point being, if it's not a big deal, there's no reason to even bring it up in the first place. 

You don't see a random character going "Hey by the way I'm straight" either, do you? 

However, involving a certain character "for the sake of showing diversity" is the worst thing you can do.

-------------------

Am gay aswell. so what a problem with woman character :-)

-------------------

Actually, there is. 

I can't recall all of them - but you do meet a few females with "female companions" etc. Also the jewelcrafting quest "A present for Lila" hints at same sex relationship (edited, apparantly ho.mo.se.xu.al.ity is a nono word on forums..) 

It's not thrown in your faces, same as no other wow relationship is "inappropriately" exposed - but it's there. And that's good!

Does it really matter? In WoW, your character cannot have relationships with NPC characters. 

In a game such as Mass Effect or Dragon Age, I'd be completely behind you if you couldn't pursue !@#$%^-*!@ relationships when you could pursue #$%^-*!@#$%^ relationships. However, in World of Warcraft, you cannot have either. 

Besides, some characters are questionably -*!@#$%^-*. Anduin and Wrathrion, for example, have had several encounters and dialogue with each other that make you question. Thus, Wrathuin was made a 'thing.' 

This topic is better to be not discussed on the forums, it paves way for religious preaching and whatever else. Though the bottom line is that relationships isn't a notable part of World of Warcraft, nor should it ever be. 

Edit: Ok... Why is !@#$-sexual and %^-*!@-sexual censored? Now that is something to talk about.

Totally agree, Blizz are damned if they do and damned if they don't on these kind of things so it's left up to the rp realms and the individual player's imagination.

-------------------

ESO has gay characters - male (as far as I remember?) and female. 

The only reason you know they're gay, is because they talk about and/or ask you to help their same gender wife, or husband. 

They don't look, or act, differently. 

So, no stereotypes. 

It's really no big deal.

There were some animated dialogue between Anduin and Wrathion in The Veiled Stair in Pandaria. I'm not too sure if it was part of the natural quest line or the legendary quest line. Wrathion referred to Anduin as "my dear Prince Anduin" and they were quite close together, so naturally, the imagination of players began to wonder.

You should know by now, it doesn't take much to kick start player imagination on the internet. Reddit is notorious for jumping to conclusions and clutching at straws. 

In any case, Wrathuin is already a thing. It's a totally different topic and it's already been debated. I just dropped it in as a possible, yet unlikely, example... That is all.

Well, the thing is, they're obviously voiced by actors and one, or both, of the actors could be gay, for all we know. 

Also, I think posh and sly can read as a bit camp, sometimes and Wrathion is definitely a posh, sly character. 

Same with thoughtfulness, maybe, to a lesser extent? 

...and Anduin is obviously thoughtful. 

So, it could be any, or all, of that making people think that way. 

Also, Americans tend to think all posh British men are gay, anyway! 

It's just the way they tend to read the accent. 

I think either of the chars could potentially be gay, or not, but I definitely don't think they have any interest of that kind in each other, personally.

with many friends and his degree, while the macho's were failing classes.

No problem with gays have a friend who is and a family member but this idea is freakin retarded why would you even think about it and i would be against lesbians as npc's to, i just think WoW shoudnt have to change its ways to suit gay or any other people its perfect the way it is with storylines and npc's and if it did i would quit because it would be un-realistic as far as WoW goes never had them and hopefully never will

I am referring to the category of men who don't tolerate, gays or anyone who is different from the "standard". This is why i mentioned the "macho-type of guys" in my previous post. N there are A LOT of those. You see or hear it every day somewhere in the world or news about those people being harassed or picked on and even in this topic many comments and downvotes prove that. 

Not to mention the special memorial days organised yearly for victims of such crimes of hate. Count the number of victims on such memorial lists. You'd be shocked. Every gay person, has a mom and a family also who loves them and get hurt by this kind of hate. 

Has nothing to do with feminism. But it is a fact that women in general are a lot more tolerant about those things, and many more things. I think there is no more place for injustice in this time, as this is not the middle ages anymore. Such intolerance needs to stop. I felt so sorry for the op after reading most of you fools comments! Imagine how he must feel after this topic. But i'm sure you have no idea by reading your comment. 
So don't bring your troll feminism comment into this subject. If there is anything I can't stand in this world, it's anything related to injustice or picking on one another!

I am gay, and I don't care about representation in World of Warcraft. 

Why? Because doing it brings out a Horde of man-babies who thinks asking for representation of your sexuality in that fantasy game you play, is like attacking having straight characters in the game. 

I am tired. I fight my battles in real life, and I have given up on the WoW community in this regard. 

My sexuality is not everything - but it is a very central thing. Simply because many things in my life involves my partner whom I love very much. 

People always say "It doesn't matter". "It is a fantasy game." "It hasn't got anything to do with the universe." 

Yet the very same people openly accept that Jainas relationship with Arthas was a major drive for her to see if she could save him in Wrath of the Lich King. 

That the fact that Thrall leave the mantle of warchief in the hands of a war criminal, in order to pursue a more neutral role - and fatherhood. 

That Sunwalker Dezco sought peace and diplomacy in Pandaria due to his wifes vision. He honored the one he loved, and sought to live by her vision. 

All of these events are character development. The very thing that define characters are the ways we perceive and identify ourselves with them due to the human traits they share with us. 

Why do you think Thrall and Sylvanas are such hugely popular characters? Because despite them being Orcs and Undead - races traditionally evil in fantasy settings - 
they have redeeming and humane qualities that we ourselves can identify with.

One VERY central piece of our identity as human beings is our sexuality. And while we do not need to stuff sexuality down people throat (although S-l-u-t-mogs and Bikini armoured Paladins does so everyday), representation can be subtle and visibile at the same time. 

If Blizzard want to use romance as a catalyst to character development I see no reason not to include gays and lesbians simply due to the fact that ho-mo-sexuality is common in the human species. But they won't because if they tried, the trolls would wind up a !@#$ storm. 
And I'd rather just be able to play the game in peace, than to listen to their crap!

All of these events are character development. The very thing that define characters are the ways we perceive and identify ourselves with them due to the human traits they share with us. 

Why do you think Thrall and Sylvanas are such hugely popular characters? Because despite them being Orcs and Undead - races traditionally evil in fantasy settings - they have redeeming and humane qualities that we ourselves can identify with. 

One VERY central piece of our identity as human beings is our sexuality. And while we do not need to stuff sexuality down people throat (although S-l-u-t-mogs and Bikini armoured Paladins does so everyday), representation can be subtle and visibile at the same time. 

If Blizzard want to use romance as a catalyst to character development I see no reason not to include gays and lesbians simply due to the fact that ho-mo-sexuality is common in the human species. 

Amazing post! This reminds me of the story of that high school friend with high intellect mentioned earlier. You guys have something special to explain yourselves. N you're able to say or write all the right words to explain things perfectly in a very emotionaly balanced way! It's something many others aren't able to do! Talent for writing N speaking with perfectly balanced emotions and reasoning! Lovely post! 

You balance between talking intellectualy and talking comprehensibly perfectly. For a lady, most of the times when a man talks to you, it's either incomprehensibly advanced, or either like a farmer or sexualy oriented. One of three opposites. This is usualy not so with gay men. It's why gay people always have a lot female friends! :o)

-------------------

it could probably work.. Swtor took it even further and introduced gay romancing options not long ago and it seems to have worked there...

No this is not a sex-game

I don't think the idea is that it would be, in any way, sexual.We 
don't see the sex lives of the straight couples in WoW, either, do we?There 
aren't any bedroom scenes!We're just told that they're married and 
if something happens to one of them, we are told that the other one is 
heart broken.The same thing could happen in WoW, with same-gender 
couples, just as it happens in games like ESO with them.No one is 
ever seen doing anything sexual and the word gay doesn't even get 
mentioned.

-------------------

All of my garrison followers are gay and happy people, sex dosn't matter as long as you are gay.

-------------------

If you want to see gay characters log into an RP server and go straight to Gold Shire there's plenty.

-------------------

Well, there's Johnny Awesome.

-------------------

There are some subtle hints here and there. But they're just that: subtle hints. 

Blizzard likely doesn't want to make any broad statements regarding this subject via in-game stuff. And rightly so, in my opinion.

-------------------

Because no character in the game will tell you; 

'Hey I'm straight. Mind finding 6 berries for me? While you're at it, run to the nearest city and hand this to my other straight friend. He'll be glad to see I haven't lost it'. 

There are characters in the game who I believe are gay and were perhaps created with the intention of them being gay/lesbian/bisexual. But is it necessary for them to announce they're gay while handing you your latest quest? No. Just like it's not necessary for the other quest givers to announce that they're straight as they hand you your latest quest.

-------------------

lol whut.since when it matters what characters are? 
Why would anyone care? or even want a character to be gay/straight 
they are characters nothing more .

-------------------

First world problems.

-------------------

Women = equal rights bla bla bla 
Gays = equal rights bla bla bla 

Why is it only gays and women that do this when in most cases (unless your muslim or live in a certain in place) you are treated totally equal, and im not talking about every woman or every gay person because some just get on with it and dont whine about a game, there are no gays in wow and hopefully there wont ever be get over it

Why is it only gays and women that do this 

Well, there are two options here, really, aren't there? 

Either gay people and women are highly irrational creatures, who complain even when there is nothing to complain about, or your assertion that they: 

25/11/2014 06:37Posted by 
8fb41a7d3994db52
are treated totally equal 

...isn't their experience. 

So, the question is, which do you think is more likely?

-------------------

I do believe there's gay NPCs and even trans gender NPCs in the game. But as you said it, a lot of gays play this game, so to me that means that each sexual group is well represented - it's really what you make of it, we the players make the world, not some NPC that gives you a quest and you never see him again. 

That said, nobody really cares what anyones sexual preference is, if you don't announce it and even then the vast majority wouldn't give a damn.

I just hope that if they do decide to add a gay character then it'll be done tastefully and respectfully. We need more gay characters in mainstream games who just happen to be gay instead of being a walking parody. 

Why? Why do we need gay characters in mainstream games? TELL ME WHY!!!!

-------------------

Not sure if it's mentioned, but I think there's a little hint of a gay character in the quest of "The Day that Deathwing Came: What Really Happened" 

It's where you get to choose several females and one 
blood elf male in a dress to join you on your Chopper, to ride your way over to Deathwing and beat him in a knife battle. 

Well, it might've been added for the giggle value, but at least it's something, right?

-------------------

Just read WoW fanfictions, OP. You'll see pairings you wouldn't have thought of in your worst nightmares. Games aren't meant to be used as a media for such statements. Just look at GW2. The previous storyline of their living story had a !@#$%^-*!@ couple and it was so cringeworthy that I wish they never would have bothered. 

They tried to be tasteful and that's what made it worse. Their romance and all their interactions were so mechanic, so calculated and so cheap that once it culminated in a near-death situation for one them (when the final boss died you got a cutscene with one of them crying over the unresponsive body of the other then magically "reviving" it with a kiss) people just groaned and asked for cutscenes to be skippabe. The very same storyline also featured a man raised by a single father, a social outcast woman and a physically disabled child. All portrayed in the same horrid Hollywood-esque fashion as the female couple. 

Besides, do you really want to be represented by the kind of writers whose take on traditional marriage is "Hush, Tyrande!" or who equate strong females with murderous psychopaths because obviously the only reason a woman would diverge from the "emotionally charged weaker sex" stereotype is becase they're turning evil and/or insane?

-------------------

Is gay a new race or species? 

You're either a man or a woman who likes the opposite s*x. 

What do you need? Transmog pink accesories?

-------------------

What are you talking about? 

Male Bloodelves?!

Why not? Or should gay characters be shut off in to special 'gay games' for all the gays to enjoy without making your stomach turn??? 

In all honestly I'm not that bothered what any character's sexuality is IF it makes sense to the story. If they want to add a relationship in to the story (of any persuasion) then it needs to make logical sense and be explained as part of the characters narrative not just plonked in to satisfy reactionary idiots.

-------------------

Why is there a need to show sexuality; this is a 12+ game. Yes there are innuendos but blizzard; because of the age rating would never do this and I actually hope they don't. 

I don't have anything against peoples sexuality, I don't have anything against the rights people have. 
What I have a problem with is the 'need' to give it awareness. Once of the best players and one of my best friends I ever made on here was gay. ( Dax represent! ) But it's something he said to me a while ago about why, he was against guilds with a gay community; 

This is a game. You're meant to be immersed into a fictional world where you are judged by nothing but your ability to play and your attitude towards effort and ability of both yourself and other players. Adding other things to this, including race, sexuality and origin would only single those people out and would, instead of them being able to be 'happier' in a supportive atmosphere, result in being victimized (No doubt because it's online) even if they didn't mention the race/ sexuality of the people involved and they are actually victimizing themselves and defining themselves as different. We are all human. There is no difference. 

Indeed this is going to no doubt cause a problem with a lot of people even discussing this. So, enjoy from here on out.

Thats no real romancing. 
Its just a little different quest giver that has other then usual (subtle)answers / reactions and he isnt your companion afterwards, so you can forget this part. 

Okay its something other ( a gay sith ) while questing but its not that far that you share a room in your ship with him;) 

After all i barely noticed that this should be the ingame 'gay'(so many where upset about), because SwToR has many funny /weird characters.

Look at all the downvotes at the op's request! Typical for men! 
Had you asked for lesbians to be added op, you would see +275. 
Most men are simple visual creatures in that regard with many staying a mental child their whole life on that aspect. No offence. But I experience it daily with men around, 
N all that nonsense about their fantasies about two women! Weirdo's! 

Write the request in a ticket to blizzard, and ignore narrowminded people N be happy! 
Don't let anyone judge you for who you are, and especialy not for sexuality reasons! 

As a matter of fact, I knew a gay boy in high school, N he was more intelligent 
and decent and sophisticated, with the capacity how to be a better friend, 
than all those good for nothing brainless macho's in class, 
that were trying to be tough and impress. In the end he left high school, 
with many friends and his degree, while the macho's were failing classes. 

You've got a nerve calling people narrow-minded when you come out with such sexist drivel. 

Ever heard of Pot-Kettle-Black Mrs Hypocrite?

-------------------

Judging by the amount of homophobia displayed by parts of the WoW community this would be an issue. I try to report it where I can but I am not sure Blizzard take homophobia particularly seriously. 

Homophobes (like racists) should be removed from the game immediately.

-------------------

I recall Theralion's original voice over. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r7vZKzTEJQ 

It was a bit too silly goose for people. I would have prefered it in game, it's brilliant.

-------------------

Um, Im for this if its done tastefully... 

I was going to say why being a persons sexual orientation into a game for kids ( yes I know adults play too), but we have so many Blood Elfs running around with skimpy outfits on lol. 

But I dont really think there is a place for it in THIS game, as its got nothing to do with sex or sexuality.... Now games like Dragon Age and Mass Effect or game with those styles sure go mad, I applaud Bio Ware for those options, and would be interesting to have Gay?lesbian characters as NPC and not just your choice in the end. 

BUT WoW and Warcaft doesn't discuss sexuality so why bring it up? 

Dont get me wrong, if blizz does make a gay character or three or 100 Im happy if its done properly and doesnt offend gays, or those less tolerant of the topic.

Ummm confused...How would you make gay characters look like lol? 

Some people i know they are just looking as anyone else, except for the fact they are gay. I honestly have no idea how would they make those kinds of characters. Slim? Bald? Longhaired? Shorthaired? Fat? Enlighten me please... ;)

-------------------

for the same reason they don't have militant vegans, for the same reason the Simpsons are yellow.. 
it's supposed to be neutral, they may touch on issues at times, but it just isn't necessary..we can play the game of life in the real world where it belongs..:)

There would be several reasons why the opening post would be downvoted which aren't directly related to social justice whatchamacallit issues. One would be that Blizzard decides what sort of characters they'll write in to the game. Second would be that there's no reason for Blizzard to highlight that aspect of the character. Third would be that there are already characters which would fall under LGBT but OP isn't looking hard enough.

I am gay, and I don't care about representation in World of Warcraft.Why? 
Because doing it brings out a Horde of man-babies who thinks asking for 
representation of your sexuality in that fantasy game you play, is like 
attacking having straight characters in the game.I am tired. I 
fight my battles in real life, and I have given up on the WoW community 
in this regard.My sexuality is not everything - but it is a very 
central thing. Simply because many things in my life involves my partner 
whom I love very much.People always say "It doesn't matter". "It 
is a fantasy game." "It hasn't got anything to do with the universe."Yet 
the very same people openly accept that Jainas relationship with Arthas 
was a major drive for her to see if she could save him in Wrath of the 
Lich King.That the fact that Thrall leave the mantle of warchief 
in the hands of a war criminal, in order to pursue a more neutral role - 
and fatherhood.That Sunwalker Dezco sought peace and diplomacy 
in Pandaria due to his wifes vision. He honored the one he loved, and 
sought to live by her vision.All of these events are 
character development. The very thing that define characters 
are the ways we perceive and identify ourselves with them due to the

Sylvanas are such hugely popular characters? Because despite them being 
Orcs and Undead - races traditionally evil in fantasy settings - they

while we do not need to stuff sexuality down people throat (although 
S-l-u-t-mogs and Bikini armoured Paladins does so everyday), 
representation can be subtle and visibile at the same time.If 
Blizzard want to use romance as a catalyst to character development I 
see no reason not to include gays and lesbians simply due to the fact 
that ho-mo-sexuality is common in the human species. But they won't 
because if they tried, the trolls would wind up a !@#$ storm. And 
I'd rather just be able to play the game in peace, than to listen to 
their crap!

This, I wasnt 100% aware of these type of storyline sin wow... kinda 
rushed through content ^^Anyways , I dont take back what I said, 
but maybe there is a place for it it WoW and Warcraft, maybe sexuality has 
been in WoW and they have just done it very well.Go for it, and 
too be honest if a Openly Gay character get countries like Russia and a 
few African countries to withdraw their support etc, well then stuff, who 
needs them.I have gay friends, and before a friend of mine came 
out, I had gone out a few times for drinks and even a movie or two, he 
came out and I carried on doing what I did before.In terms of 
religion though, people need to get a life..... Im Christian, but I do not 
say muslims are the devil, or gay my die or what ever, that God duty to 
condemn or Judge if he see fit to do so... Not mine a a creation of God, 
but Religious people alway make some story up, anyone seen that Moster 
Energy drinks area product of the devil??Anyways, back on topic 
sorry.... Go for it Blizz, you have my support, if its done tastefully and 
within the story of WoW and character development then 100% supported

I'll probably get shot down for this - but I was wondering why WoW has no gay characters? Gays play the game too, and it's the 21st Century and all. 

A lot of young people play the game, and it'd make a good impression, and help people be more accepting in everyday life. 

Yes, I'm gay, and don't really care about the homophobes, but think WoW would be doing themselves a service if they implemented a character into the game which is gay. 

Let's say they do it, how do we know he's gay? Will he be, like, 24/7 in action? And with whom? I suppose one gay is not enough, there should be at least two. May be there should be also an annual gay parade in Stormwind.

-------------------

Don't want nor gays nor lesbians. 

That's kinda overkill.

-------------------

sexuality - h0m0, hetr0, bi - whatever it is - is a human CONCEPT.....the IDEAL of sexuality is purely OURS....driven by the society we live in. 

same s3x happens in the animal kingdom EVERYWHERE - but there are no labels on it there....nor do the chimps care if they see two males or females.....they just get on with whatever else they are doing... 

its not the representation in popular cultural media formats that needs looking at, but the need to DEFINE oneself that needs to be looked at....individually 

WHY label yourself ANYTHING? - by doing so, you define and restrict yourself....you bind yourself into the meaning of your own definition, and in doing so, deny yourself the possibility of discovery. 

personally i dont care if you are male, female, black, white, orange, gay, straight or like same sex martian women relationships.....its totally irrelevant to me....i either like you as a person or i dont. 

similarly in a game,....i dont care if we rescue thralls love child from molten giants, or anduins male lover (for example). 

i understand that over the years, "minority" groups have had to face persecution and downright bigotry....and i feel for people in those categories....but not because they are gay, black or whatever - simply because the forced suppression of any ideology is bad in my books.....its should be allowed to be aired....YES you can disagree with it, openly and voicibly if you wish....that goes hand in hand with the freedom to express an opinion in the first place, but it should never be suppressed. 

a fantasy video game isnt the platform to do that on though.....its a fantasy world, with fantasy races - whos to say they even HAVE the same cultural ideals as us...isnt that a bit egotistical of us? 
h0m0sexuality may not even BE a concept ever thought of to say the trolls.....its just accepted that some girls like girls....theres no LABEL for it.

-------------------

It is a 12 rated game, And as a parent I certainly don't want my child playing with gay characters (NOTHING PERSONAL) In other words there is a time and place for everything, And WOW is not a place to promote your preferred sexuality, I am here to relax and socialise regardless of gender, race or sexuality.

The OP has almost 30 votes down? I haven't read any of the discussion here, but yeah, my best friend and I are also gay. 

Thumb this down, too.

-------------------

Lets be honest, would we even notice if the character was gay? 
Considering how much attention we give to random quest givers we would probably miss it. Unless he was a comic relief or was shoving that fact in our face.

-------------------

I think WoW shouldn't have to have gay characters just for the sake of having gay characters or being progressive. I want this game to have great and memorable characters and if one of them happens to be gay, so be it. That would be completely fine. 
Just don't make being 'gay' the driving force behind any character. I don't care about social justice propaganda invading video games.

-------------------

Roll a blood elf male. Seems gay.

-------------------

The bottom line here is how do we know that some of the NPC's are not gay? Did anyone know Dumbledore was gay until J K Rowling announced it? Did it change the character in any way? Do you need to have a sign up saying "This NPC is gay" just for it to be true?

-------------------

Hahahah.. Epic post. But... Respectfully 

This game does NOT display people sexuality, It does NOT display that you are hetrofile or gay, which is how It should be. 

You can dress however you like within the transmog gear, gay or not. anyhow It's not the game consern to display you're personal sexual orientation, which is fine as it is.

-------------------

Every major male character is gay in this game. Just look at Garrosh, Grommash and Varian. All three represent the typical "macho-man" stereotype; they are overcompensating by using violence as a equaliser for being homoerotic. 

Running around with their bulging sweaty muscles, in skimpy outfits, competing with each other who is the "baddest" and who have the greatest chin. . 

The violence thus becomes the "middle ground" which naturalises the homoeroticism between the object (the characters) and the adoring viewers eye. Soon the physical attraction the main lore characters share for each other which is neutralized by the violence become obvious. 

We love it because of the same reason we watched movies starring Arnold, Stallone, Dolph etcetera when we were kids; there is something special with a big hunky man beating up numerous bad guys with his bare hands. 
That something special touches a young boys heart in a very special way whatever your preferred gender attraction is. 

This whole expansion is an 80s B-action homoerotic movie and that's why I love it so much. I look forward to watching Grommash, Blackhand and the crew be "manly" and sexual. 
Hopefull we will also see the "wolf" (lol.. not gay at all ) Varian be the manly man of the Alliance like he always is. Protecting the "weaker" races with his manliness. 

Soon it becomes a competition of who is the most macho, who have the most muscles, who is the most sexual during the violence. A competition of who is the most homoerotic. 

WoD = a teenage boys dream

Who cares really I don't, Didn't spoil the enjoyment of the film or books... 

This community is that vile at times, I really think if people where to make gay chars they would be an onslaught of abuse aimed at them. 

Look at the number of threads about LFD AND LFG, I was abused kicked and so forth... Do we really need to fuel the fire for these people any more ??

-------------------

There are gay npc's in the game. One quest in particular in badlands portrays a bloodelf male as a female. Also in un' goro I seem to remember a quest getting a "handbag" for a male npc. 

There are plenty of "references" to gender preferences throughout the game, but I am of the opinion that sexual preferences should stay out of a game, that has no sexual meaning within it.

That has little to do with gay characters. It´s about the common joke about mistaking blood elf males with females.

You have an anime named 'Akame Ga Kill!' with a character in it named Bulat. 
He was a really awesome guy and turned out to be gay as one of the members told a new member (the lead character), they did him real well as there was nothing cliche, stupid or flamboyant about him and he was just one of the leading fighters who happened to be a pretty awesome one too. 
That is how I like it done, no weird joke type of personality, just one of the guys who happens to be gay, simple.

(P.s i think its very brave to bring this to the wow community OP you have my respect) 

Amazing post! This reminds me of the story of that high school friend with high intellect mentioned earlier. You guys have something special to explain yourselves. N you're able to say or write all the right words to explain things perfectly in a very emotionaly balanced way! It's something many others aren't able to do! Talent for writing N speaking with perfectly balanced emotions and reasoning! Lovely post! 

You balance between talking intellectualy and talking comprehensibly perfectly. For a lady, most of the times when a man talks to you, it's either incomprehensibly advanced, or either like a farmer or sexualy oriented. One of three opposites. This is usualy not so with gay men. It's why gay people always have a lot female friends! :o)

Ok whilst you are being very nice and kind to the poster you replied to, do you not realise that you are basically saying here that the only reason he is able to write such a wonderfully written post is because of his seCsual orientation, THIS IS PART OF THE PROBLEM! I would have taken offense to what you written if it was in reply to me , you then further go on to say basically nobody who is "straight" couldv written this post.... Wow, Irony much?

As a parent myself i would have ZERO problem with a game that has gay/lesbian playable/npc/characters in game.... i Smell a troll sorry, Whilst your free to raise your children any way you please that is legal, i feel i have to remind you that as this game you say yourself is rated 12 , i am assuming the theoretical child in question is at least 12 years old right? Else you are already being an irresponsible parent, He/She`S NOT A CHILD ANYMORE , its 52 weeks from becoming a Teenager assuming its thier birthday today! WAKE UP 
There is Alot more evils in the world to be raising your childs defenses against than something as insignificant as this.

Why? Why do we need gay characters in mainstream games? TELL ME WHY!!!! 

Maybe because being gay 
is mainstream? 

Gay people can not only openly have relationships, but can get married in many places, including parts of the US and in the UK. 

So, unless you make some sort of backstory that being openly gay is disallowed in the society in question, surely it's unrepresentative to not show it (at least subtly)? 

In historical games, which are based on reality, you could argue that it was frowned upon back then, to be openly gay; so, to show it in any kind of open way would be inaccurate. 

But in games which portray the present (in the West, anyway), the future, or some kind of alternate universe, to not show it and to not explain why you're not showing it, basically equals a glaring omission. 

People, in the future, will probably talk about the time when gay relationships were not portrayed in games, despite them being widely accepted IRL at the time.

As another parent, with two adult children, I have to ask you, why? What terrible thing do you think is going to happen? 
My lads both had school-friends who have since come out. They are still friends with these guys and they are still straight. It wasn't an issue. 

Relationships are major story-line drivers, so why shouldn't some of the relationships in the game be same-sex? 
Sad to think I'm nearing retirement age and this topic is still controversial.

Couldnt agree more with this, However im firmly convinced there are indeed same gender relationships in wow just subtle ones, like someone said earlier JK rowlings masterpiece Harrypotter series , one of the most beloved and famous characters was revealed to be Gay years later, an absolute genius move which shocked and surprised millions, Does it make the books or films any less enjoyable or successful? i argue it makes ZERO impact on anything, which is why JK Rowling chose to not openly reveal it in the story, because it truly has no bearing or influence on anything besides character development.

It's not the point of 'oh its mainstream and they need to be represented' It's more a case of a select group of humans defining themselves as different, demanding special treatment which they will only (NOT BY ME) get ridiculed for by the massive amounts of trolls on this game. 

THEN it will be... "Why did you make gay NPC's? People make more fun now!" Because THAT is how the internet works.

It's a freaking game. Things shouldn't 
have to be represented. Woman will be next claiming about the way the lore is with a lot of the 'clan' like races. How the males would go and hunt (sometimes females yes) and the females would rear their young. "OH BUT IT MUST BE EQUAL NUMBERS". 

NO.

I'm gay too, and I couldn't care less. For most of the NPC's in game it's not even known what their sexual preference is. This is fantasy game, not some representation of our society where each minority in terms of religion, handicaps, sexual preference, political views, whatever should be there. 

There IS a gay reference in the game now that I think of it. That quest in Badlands, where you can pick the male blood elf, as a male orc, and then they "share a tender moment". Loved that quest :)

i guess at the end of the day we are talking about VISUAL representation here.....things being openly visually one thing or another.... 

in life, some types of disability ARE visual, wheelchairs for example....but there are far far more disabilities that arent......using disability as an example, HOW would you represent those in a game? 

equally - with sexuality......unless you pick stereotypes, which arent always flattering, how exactly do you openly and visually represent sexuality? 

yes, you can have quests, as suggested above, find mankriks boyfriend....for example.....but to look at an npc and go "yeah hes gay" - how do you represent that, without resorting to typecasting? 

perhaps a hairy mechano-hog rider in the defias leather set, with handlebar gnome moustache? 
not very flattering really is it, also open to ridicule... 
you portray them simply like you would everyone else.....because they ARE the same as everyone else....

I'll probably get shot down for this - but I was wondering why WoW has no gay characters? Gays play the game too, and it's the 21st Century and all. 

A lot of young people play the game, and it'd make a good impression, and help people be more accepting in everyday life. 

Yes, I'm gay, and don't really care about the homophobes, but think WoW would be doing themselves a service if they implemented a character into the game which is gay. 

There are plenty of gear out there to make your character look gay. 
As an example, if you are a warrior, you can transmog the AQ40 set, and you can get purple axes.

Well, in a way I agree with you. 

Who cares which gender it turns out someone prefers? 

Especially if they're not in a serious relationship, at the time. 

There is absolutely no need to announce that a single person is gay, for example. 

However, the problem is that we see straight serious relationships (marriages etc.) openly referenced, all the time, in games. 

If serious romantic relationships (gay, or straight) were never openly referenced, you might have a point. 

But, as they are, the danger is that it makes it look like, either the writer is intentionally hiding gay relationships, or the chars are being portrayed as hiding their own gay relationships, due to them being ashamed, or scared, or whatever. 

That is the problem here, I think.

-------------------

I don't see the point. 

What next, we want to have a poster in Stormwind celebrating how change is needed since man's gold coin is woman's 75 silver? 

While I support both movement, I don't wander every game and every game forum preaching about how men also are victims of domestic violence or how it needs more attention and how my games should somehow teach people to fight against it.

In historical games, which are based on reality, you could argue that it was frowned upon back then, to be openly gay; so, to show it in any kind of open way would be inaccurate. 

That really depends on when and where :). 

Besides that, esp because it should be mainstream by now, it should need no emphasis. Whatever you need to emphasize, apparently is still weird or uncommon. I kinda like Blizzard's attitude on this one as they aren't flinging it in your face but there's subtle hints in several places, kinda like irl where you usually don't know people's sexual orientation within the first 5 minutes. 

I wouldn't mind more of that. I would mind it tho if it gets rubbed in. Not because of my sensitive feelings but simply because that usually does more harm than good, esp when it comes to storytelling.

-------------------

Just had an idea, Why not have an in-game event , ALA Gay-Pride , its pretty much become a worldwide recognised event, and it stands for much more than just its name, to quote a certain US president... 

"I call upon all Americans to observe this month by fighting prejudice and discrimination in their own lives and everywhere it exists" – Proclamation by U.S President Barack Obama, May 31, 2011 

i think it could work, by not focusing on the seCsual discrimination , but ALL discrimination, maybe rename as , WoW-Pride , Horde an ally , All races and genders, can go on a huge March / Rally , How would you feel if this was a thing?

-------------------

I've met and know multiple gay people and some I instantly dislike, it's not because they are gay but the way they act. We all know that typical gay stereotype what got most of the people disliking them. While being gay is no more then simply being attracted to the same sex. It has nothing to do with how you should or are acting. What clothes you got and they way you are talking. Still some thing it's nesessary to change all that. 

And my guess will be a gay character ingame will become exacty like that. And let it be that most of the people I know dislike people like that. 

No I'm no homophobe but I dislike people like that and I think they give a bad name and bad stereotype to gay people. One of the biggest events *Gay parade* isn't helping either. 

Making a gay character ingame will not improve this! Since it will be overdone, over the top and thats how some gays act yes indeed. But those gays are the onces ruining it for the rest.

What about the discrimination of EVERYTHING. Just, gay pride deserves more recognition because of the way someone feels about another? That's complete bull. 
Oppression, deserves awareness in the REAL WORLD where it matters. 
Awareness of being gay doesn't deserve anything. 
don't mistake my words, I am all for equalization but in that respect. Equalization should give EVERYTHING recognition which would then eliminate the point of awareness. Which is the way it should be. EQUAL. This thread is complete toxic garbage.

Well, I wouldn't (personally) ever want to see an "I'm gay, BTW!" type of announcement in text! xD 

In fact, as a straight woman, I don't really even have a horse in this race, from a personal preference POV. 

Really, all I'm trying to say is that, if we are regularly presented with references to committed straight relationships, we should probably also (albeit, less frequently - as fewer people are gay) be presented with the occasional reference to a committed gay relationship. 

Just in the interest of accuracy, honesty and balance, if nothing else.

I wont go into it on here.... 

me Sometimes being over protective is not an issue in this case or blaming others, It is allowing the mind to heal though natural process, Without the influence of sexuality. 

Allowing their normal development to take place, if they turn out to be gay, I don't care their still my child. 

The issue remains it is a 12 rated game legal age for sex is 16 in this country last time I looked 

And really this game should stay neither hetro, Lesbian or gay, On the fence if you like.

As much as I loathe racism and any other kind of discrimination IRL this couldn´t be a thing in WoW. 
Warcraft´s foundations are based on the racism and intollerance the different races from the Alliance and the Horde feel for each other. It would invalidate the two faction system completely.

What has gender preferrence got to do with anything in WOW. 

If the LGBT community wants to be accepted into every day life and treated no different to anyone else then they should stop making a big deal out 
being LGBT. You cannot hold yourself seperate from everyone else and expect to be treated the same as everyone else.

-------------------

Why does there need to be a openly gay character? I'm sorry but this is a video game we don't need to know the sexuality of pixels plus how do we know that some aren't already just because they aren't parading round in rainbow coloured chaps doesn't mean they're not gay. I play video games to escape reality not have real life issues rammed down my throat. Before I get anti gay stupidity thrown at me my best friend of 25 years is gay I've gone to gay clubs ect with him have many other gay friends I just don't see the need for this to happen.

my daughter *knew* she was gay before the age of 16...she had feelings towards other females that went beyond friendship, so she talked to me and her mother about her feelings......sex never came into it....if it had, i would probably have been as Intolerant as the next parent talking with their child about under-aged sex :D 

i guess the point is - just because your child is under a certain age - doesnt mean they should be sheltered from everything....people walk down the street every day, you wouldnt cover their eyes if a man/woman couple walked by holding hands....similarly you wouldnt if two men/women did....... 

thats how i feel about it being in a game......it shouldnt be openly promoted, nor should it be hidden.....as i said earlier, you portray them as you would everyone else, because they ARE like everyone else 
::D

-------------------

We have blood elves don't we? 

Sorry.... I had to... :P 

Anyways, this is kind of a pointless thing to add to this game. This is not a bioware game where we interact with characters in dialogue and find out exactly how their personality works. If this is what you are after, you should try out SWTOR, as that is the only mmo I know that has something like this.

Indeed, this sort of thing when discussed seriously isn't toxic. But everyone is posting massive amounts of crap about how it's effecting/ effected them in an aggressive manner which is provoking people. I'm saying the way this was constructed as garbage. I do disagree with the OP and I've given my point in it before. Being gay doesn't make you special; though it doesn't make you less of a human being. It makes you the same as everyone else. Unless being oppressed, why does it deserve more recognition then other things? Please, explain to me. I'm against people being oppressed for their sexuality, yes. but not for recognition for their sexuality as if it's something special. Because that is what is toxic. Everyone is human, Race, gander, sexuality, what ever. 

How does quoting add me to the problem? It's showing what I'm talking about= otherwise it would just be a cluster of random things being said and it would be difficult to follow. How is that better? Enlighten me please.

-------------------

What I'm finding interesting, in this thread, is how conservative a lot of people are. 

I hope no one believes that a child, who sees a committed gay relationship represented in a game, would be more inclined to become gay? 

Sexuality is set in the womb or, at the latest, in early childhood (in the case of boys). 

By the time a child is 12, it is pretty much set in stone, from what I understand (and has been for some time). 

Maybe the finer nuances may still be influenced, but the basics, like orientation, are already set. 

The conservatism is even more interesting, given that, if anyone even dares to mention, on here, that seeing violence in games 
may possibly encourage IRL violence, for some people, they get shot down in flames. 

But, apparently, some people don't feel the same way about even subtle and sensitively done references to sexuality? 

Interesting.

All ready answered this nothing wrong with being gay or lesbian, But no place for it in a fictional game with a 12 rating 

If I want that sort of content it is normally classed as an 18. I would purchase an 18, WOW, is meant to be a break from real life. I know some people cant tell the difference but fetching sexual preference in, What's next ?

recognition, just some. If they did and I missed it, please feel free to 
correct me.Putting in a few gay characters who aren't stereo-types, 
male orcs rather than belfs for example, is not going to detract from the 
game if it's done tastefully. I'd welcome it.

The fact that, apparently, the topic of one's sexuality is still something people have fierce and heated debates over is just one more indication for humanity's eventual doom. 

Really people. It's 2014. Some people love people of the same sex. Get over it.

Agreed it is 2014 same sex marriages I know quite a few couples, Even been to some of the weddings. 

But that's real LIFE !

no place for it in a fictional game with a 12 rating 

Since same sex marriage is recognised in a lot of European countries and since many children live with couples who are same sex, why is it inappropriate to show similar relationships in-game? 
Explicit sexual behaviour between npcs would be inappropriate of course, regardless of orientation but I don't think anyone is advocating that.

-------------------

As long as it makes sense in the narrative. A character being gay because it made sense is a good thing. A character being gay because someone at Blizzard went "We should make a gay character because we need to be politically correct." is not a good thing. 

In the end, this should be a non-issue. It doesn't matter whether you are gay, bisexual or !@#$%^-*!@#$ (gay and bisexual are okay but h e t e r o sexual is not...?). Sadly we are still at the point where threads like this are made because clearly being gay is not accepted yet. At this point the introduction of any major, gay character would be contrived for that very reason. It would always reek of political correctness and that is sad. 

All ready answered this nothing wrong with being gay or lesbian, But no place for it in a fictional game with a 12 rating 

If I want that sort of content it is normally classed as an 18. I would purchase an 18, WOW, is meant to be a break from real life. I know some people cant tell the difference but fetching sexual preference in, What's next ? 
And h e t e r o sexuality somehow is not 18+? You realise you are fumbling with double standards here, do you?

Why not to add then some Zoophiles into the game ? It's 2014. 

Because bestiality isn't a consensual thing. 

It's a human being abusing/taking advantage of an animal. 

It's immoral because an animal can't give consent. 

Whereas, as long as both parties are adult human beings, being gay is as consensual as being straight, so it's morally OK. 

Shouldn't even have to be saying this, but still.

It's not like have something against gays or anything. The main question is WHY do you need gay toons in game. 

No, you don't "have anything against gays", you just compared them to people who have sex with animals. 

Try being less obvious next time.

-------------------

There's already an entire race of them, right in Silvermoon.

-------------------

I am jumping on this bus a bit late, but here goes anyway. Although I am gay myself, I would not want to see !@#$%^-*!@ity portrayed in WoW. 

Keeping in mind that most fantasy settings tend to emulate a Middle Age monarchy with the high king and all, it would seem quite unnatural for the developers to go out of their way to represent #$%^-*!@#$ity. I don't mind a passing reference to a same sex couple or such. 

If it can be done seamlessly and subtly, then sure. But I fear that the prevailing stigma ( at least in my country where I can still not be openly gay without ridicule) would turn a tactful normality into something of a circus. 

Besides, if the story does not need it, then it is forced. And anything forced is not cool. 

Edit: OMW, 
that is censored?!

That isn't outlawed in a lot of counties, same goes with gay relations they are still outlawed in few countries. 

While i completely ok with gays being around i just can't see the reason why they should be in the game outside of the reason, gay themself trough WoW want to show that's normal to be a gay and gain some approval.

What I have a problem with is the 'need' to give it awareness. Once of

( Dax represent! ) But it's something he said to me a while ago about 
why, he was against guilds with a gay community;This is a game. You're 
meant to be immersed into a fictional world where you are judged by 
nothing but your ability to play and your attitude towards effort and

It is. 

An animal can't speak and generally has a lower level of brain function than a normal human being, so it is considered abusive, or (at the very least) taking advantage. 

If you're going to say that some animals appear to participate, that is irrelevant. 

They can't give consent, so it is not the same thing at all.

Too risky.

-------------------

Sexuality is a personal thing I dont think everyone needs to go and shout about it, any of the characters could be gay without it defining the persona. 

Its why I can never understand people who act like the only gay in the village character from little britain.

My opinion is fact, in this case. 

I'm talking about consent, or the lack of it and that is fact. 

The fact that it is not illegal in some places is also irrelevant. 

Some truly hideous things are legal in some places, as I'm sure you know. 

Something being legal doesn't, automatically, make it right. 

That's why concrete things like consent are so important.

Let me put it another way, gay with down sydrome is getting abused by his gay healthy couple ? 

It's not irrelevant from your point of view, and law in some countries support your idea, in other - not. Same with gays. 

Both things fall under "sexual preferences". You argue that it's 2014 and people are thick minded, i showed you another side of the coin which is not approved but still exist.

its NOT toxic to want recognition for something....i personally find it 
strange..."ok, you're gay, heres a lollipop" kind of thing....but its not 
toxic....like i said, it should be equal representation...without fanfare, 
or drums, without overtly reverting to type....if there are *gay* quests 
or npcs, fine, whatever its irrelevant to me personally....but there 
should be at least *some* form of representation....not hidden away in the 
cellar of the lions pride, nor on display from the rooftops of 
dalaran...it should simply just - be.so on one hand, i accept and 
support the op....lets have that representation - but on the other, it

Why is there a need to show sexuality; this is a 12+ game. Yes there are 
innuendos but blizzard; because of the age rating would never do this 
and I actually hope they don't.

please explain why 12yo kids can play/read about jaina and arthas romance 
and can't, instead, about same gender couples. i am afraid of the answer 
tbh.

Where is the disabled NPCS? I don't see the people stuck in a wheelchair 
complaining. No doubt I've said it, wait for it....

people in wheelchair probably don't exist in a world where you can cast 
healing spells at will and revive the dead.

it's a freaking game. Things shouldn't have 
to be represented.

Do you need to have a sign up saying "This NPC is gay" just for it to be 
true?

a plain romance would be more than enough, there's no need to make a whole 
expansion and several dungeons about it as if it were for the cutscenes 
regarding arthas and jaina.

The thread, as a whole is toxic. Not the point of the thread. 
It's baiting trolls, people will be offended unfortunately because it's not right for people to abuse others for what ever reason. 

However. If you were to just come by sexuality; the only thing I could come across just normally playing is Thrall and Aggra having a child. Other than that, being straight isn't blatant. In fact, other than digging for it, it's no where to be found, but then you can find -insert the day deathwing came quest- which referances to !@#$%^-*!@ity. Other than that. Why should either be represented anymore than this?

a 12 year old would have to go seriously digging and buy that novel to find out about the romance. It's not actually that easy to find. It fits with the lore. If there was gay romance fitting with the lore; then yeah, I'd probably be okay with it. But I fail to see how ANY sexuality should and would play a role in lore.

The issue remains it is a 12 rated game legal age for sex is 16 in this country last time I looked 

my daughter *knew* she was gay before the age of 16...she had feelings towards other females that went beyond friendship, so she talked to me and her mother about her feelings......sex never came into it....if it had, i would probably have been as Intolerant as the next parent talking with their child about under-aged sex :D 

i guess the point is - just because your child is under a certain age - doesnt mean they should be sheltered from everything....people walk down the street every day, you wouldnt cover their eyes if a man/woman couple walked by holding hands....similarly you wouldnt if two men/women did....... 

thats how i feel about it being in a game......it shouldnt be openly promoted, nor should it be hidden.....as i said earlier, you portray them as you would everyone else, because they ARE like everyone else 
::D 

That's good parenting being able to talk, In a calm reflected manor, With your child, Being able to offer advise and support. More so if it is against your beliefs. SEX in this house is discussed but on their level, and only when they fetch the subject up, living in a rural country village the district nurse is a god send. 
More so with the past history.(Also helped as a councillor at the time) 

Females do develop quicker in the mind and sexually. Some blokes never grow up I am sorry to say. 

True we shouldn't shelter a child but we also shouldn't show them all the world has to offer, We need to let them discover that for themselves not all at that age have the ability to fully get a grasp on what their seeing, on the streets as you rightfully mentioned. 

Should we ban it hell no, It would drive us back to the stone age, But I will stick to my guns !@#$%^-*!@ity has no place in a 12 rated game, Even if they already know about it, We don't have the power to alter the laws of the land without the vote. 

Even then those people are not open minded, and that opens a completely new can of worms to discuss at a later date.

Okay, there is more than I've noticed but it's not because I'm conditioned to think it's normal. In fact, that's a little bit too far to say that in my opinion. I understand and realise that how people feel about others is just that. It's how they feel. I wouldn't say it's normal, I wouldn't say it's abnormal either. The reason it's abused is because it's campaigned for being seen as normal which I believe is wrong; normal defines something unnatural about things. Being human is normal, it shouldn't go any further than that. Everyone is built up of the same things so why should anything else matter. 

But saying about having children is making straight recognized isn't correct. That's reproduction; if that wasn't to be then Garrosh, Thrall, Heck. Anduin, saurfang.... Etc would ruin the game if they were not there. Since they play a massive role and reproduction adds to the lore. Their sexuality isn't thrown into it. Differentiation is key here. Unless you're conditioned to look for things that do not exist.

the kids in themselves, i agree....the fact he has a wife and kids 
suggests that at least in part he has heter0 feelings....perhaps at a 
stretch you could say hes bisexual......if you wanted to throw something 
on him.i didnt actually say he was straight anyway, i said hes in a 
heter0 relationship - with his wife, by definition - he is.go 
around a town and look at the npc names....married couples are all over - 
with the same surname, and often with overt references to their 
husbands.....theres low level quests in stormwind where you have to take a 
sons tailoring package form his mother to his farthers shop 
iirc......little subtle things....that suggest heter0sexual 
relationships......they literally are ALL over.my feelings are 
that the op is asking for little things like that - just simple 
representation.the fact it HAS to be asked for and drawn attention to 
ISNT flag waving as such....it isnt asking for MORE representation than 
heter0 stuff, its asking for the same.....it only has more attention when 
its asked for....

There are gay character in the game. 
There is a openly gay Blood Elf in the quest chain in Badlands , where you ride a bike and go punch Deathwing or something. 
There is also the one in the Bombing of Theramore Horde version.While he doesnt say it , he hints at being gay.He is a Blood Elf again...Hmmm , Im starting to see a pattern...:D 

Anyway , there arent any main characters that are confirmed gay.And thats because it doesnt matter.It wont affect the story , it wont add anything to it.Thats their personal thing , its not their defining trait.That wont help them kill the Lich king , wont enrich the story one bit.Why add something pointless?

that suggest heter0sexual relationships 

There are innuendos to suggest gay npcs in the game as there is, it's just not blaring out at you. 
As I said, if you're looking for those things; you will find things suggesting straight npcs. 
namely offspring but I covered that.

I understand that it would probably to good for people who are gay to feel more accepted. But this is a game. Doing so in the real world would make a whole lot of difference I agree, and it would do good. But in a fictional universe would probably do more worse than good. 

Being victimized by society in the real world; goes to the fictional world because they're accepted (Indeed it is right that they are accepted since they are human) but surely that would only make them (If you're looking at it this way) feel more trapped? 

Ever since I've played (TBC- Not bragging just to give an idea of what I mean by what I say next) I have found probably the most enlightening, accepting, nicest community being gamers. Since the player base is so diverse in origin and who the people are; It's extremely nice to know I am a part of it. While I don't believe in casting aside things like this, in contrast with the real world I don't see how it will do any good.

I would have expected a topic like this to have 32 upvotes, not 32 dislikes. I'm not sure if people realize exactly how negative a picture this paints of the WoW community. It's 2014, humanity should really be above all this by now. 

The OP is indeed correct. There should be a few gay characters. The main reason there isn't is that Blizzard as a business can't risk it. Too many parents would force their children to unsubscribe. Then they'll probably go buy them some 18's rated shooting game. :/ 
Parents are probably the worst offenders on this topic, seeing people treated equally wont turn your children gay (as if that was even an issue), it just means they'll learn to treat everyone equally too. 

Gay characters in WoW doesn't mean publicly announcing it or showing inappropriate content either. There are plenty of relationships or people who like each other in WoW already. All it would mean is the exact same thing as that, except replacing one person for the opposite gender.

innuendos to suggest gay npcs

innuendo is a human concept, and is purely subjective....YOU may see a man 
in pink clothes and think - *innuendo, hes gay* - i may see the same man 
and think *what a dapper gentleman*a man and a woman, with children, 
and the same surname - are NOT innuendo, its implicit, especially when the 
quest they give you is "find my husband" or "take this to my son, hes in 
his fathers shop"it is implicitly stated that the relationship is 
heter0.......

You really think gayness get's good recognision if it's get forced to people? I really dont care if people are gay or not. Still it doesn't mean I want to see men kiss other men. It still grosses me out. 

And your ooh come on it's 2014 get over it comment will not work. It's not the normal thing to do!

-------------------

I.... can't.... resist commenting this topic. 

I think it's good of you to give your suggestion, thumbs up for that. And I can kind of relate to you, but I don't think Warcraft stories need to be adapted to political motives in the real life. 

I mean your main reason to your suggestion is because you want hömos€xuals to be more accepted in the society, which has nothing to do with the game. World of Warcraft is a fantasy game about war, it isn't a human rights organisation to get rid of all sort of discrimination that has been going on for centuries in the real life. 

I don't want too much political correctness in a story called Warcraft nor a game called World of Warcraft. You can't please everyone and make "all sort of people" with different backgrounds feel home. 

I was actually thinking of it earlier today before I read this topic, what if everyone wanted Blizzard to make every person's character adapted to how we are in the real life. Like if people complained that the human race should also have more Asian like faces. And that some people maybe wants a wheelchair because they've never been able to walk and so on. 

I think everyone should forget about the real life when it comes to give suggestions about World of Warcraft and try to just focus on the fantasy world. :)

Yes, I'm gay, and don't really care about the homophobes, but think WoW would be doing themselves a service if they implemented a character into the game which is gay. 

Let me tell you something about Gay. Since you are one you should know why are people act against them like they do. 

There is NOTHING wrong with being gay it is normal and it comes with being brought to this world. But what people doing like is something called "PRIDE" it is gay movement every year. 

People never get angry on you or fight you when you walk with boyfriend being gay, people are bothered when gays are PUBLICLY telling and walking with rainbows on streets , WE ARE GAY , WE ARE GAY!! ... this is what people hate. 

Just shut the hell up and be what you are and live normaly like some do, you don't have to do it in public and scream look at me Im gay. This is example also this forum thread. 

You want a gay character, and you wanna let know everybody that you are gay and how you don't care about someone other "quoting you: homophobes in this case" . This is the problem, as long as gay people walk and do their normal thing like other nobody will care, but ofc if you walk in public with "movement of gay people" that has papers and rainbows showing "im gay we want more rights" its normal that you gonna get beaten up. 

In this case u got beaten up via forum and online... and what is for you " gay character " gay normal look as same just as casual people do, or are you special kind with perfect looks ? Define me gay looking character.

this game never depicts kiss or sex scenes so you have nothing to worry about even if they put a gay couple at every corner. 

why are straight people allowed to voice they feel "grossed out" while gay players have to witness straight romances in the plot and simply accept they can't be part of it?

I was wondering why WoW has no gay characters? Gays play the game too, and it's the 21st Century and all. 

WoW is not 21 century, wow doesn't care about political, social or whatever stuff going in our society, wow is an own fantasy world and it's purpose is to get people playing in that world, not to bring our world into it. 

There might be some notions here and there (Anduin for example and Darnassus guards) but it's a conservative world, it moves by its own current and has its own ways to hide or express things, so the only thing we can do is guess.

It's more this than anything else. I take hardly any notice of other peoples sexuality since it doesn't interest me in the slightest. There are hardly anything to so with SEXUALITY. There are things to do with offspring; like I said it's differentiating between them. They are not the same thing. Seeing them as, IS social conditioning. 

-theres a HUGE difference in debating something, and acting obtuse...if you dont know the difference then ill stand by my assumption...nothing said so far has changed it- 

There is something we can agree on.

To the OP...I think Blizzard provides plenty of characters and features to support the gay community in-game.

There are gay presentations in the game, the primary one to pop into mind the Night Elf and Tauren in Hyjal. But here you go;

That is because the OP tries to force gay characters into the game as some 
sort of gay-quotum. As much as I agree that the state of gay-acceptance is 
lacking, instating quotas is not the way to solve that.A couple 
posts down from the OP there is a post that is reasonable - and it has 31

-------------------

The PC around everything is getting out of hand.

-------------------

Don't understand. I thought the idea behind a tolerant and compassionate society was not to even notice the differences in people. And you want them to emphasise a certain trait in a character. So do you go around with a sticker on your head saying you are gay. Personally I couldn't care less what you are, I just see people. Even if characters in the game were to be gay.. how would you know. What would you like to see them doing. 

Maybe you should watch the episode of Southpark where Chef realises suddenly that he is the only one that sees the colour of peoples skin.

-------------------

Rather sad reading some of these comments, stuff long the lines of 'people can be gay as long they don't get any of it on me or my kids!'.

like many say i dont think a MMORPG is in need of Gay NPC characters, the game has its seriousness but lots of comic values too and like Budd on the boat to Vash'jr he is actually Gay i mean hes gotta be the typical stereo type of one - "iiiiim saaaiiilliiiing" etc. 

but yeah theres no need for Quota's of "Gay" or this game is not gay enough - like really why are you even bothered? 

you can meet fellow gays online that play but the game story, and probably Lore- has followed standard sexuality - Men either big hulky warrior type smash smash or wise people 
woman cooking and cleaning and raising their kids - wait what. 

this post is really stupid imo and just pointless. 

i am 100% straight but i have no disregard to gay men - gay women etc im fine with em and i wouldnt be like eww dont touch me i dont want to catch anything. 
so ladies heres a caring single guy that is very open to the world - hit me up

Just shut the hell up and be what you are and live normaly like some do, you don't have to do it in public and scream look at me Im gay. This is example also this forum thread. 

First of all I must say I agree with the notion that in order to be treated equally you must begin by treating yourself equally as well, not expecting any kind of special treatment just because of your choice of sexuality. Thus why I also agree this game doesn´t need a gay character just for the sake of being gay. 

With that out of the way I must say I wish what you said was true. Never in my life did anyone discover I was gay until I had a boyfriend. I live just like anyone else and dress just like anyone else. This should be stupid to say, but you never know... 
Now I can´t say I´m abused or look at with bad eyes, but there are times when I go out with my husband and youngsters and children call us censored things. You think it´s because we are declaring we are gay or kissing or making out in public? No: we just hold hands at most, or sometimes not even that; since they know us they insult us just because we have different sexual tastes than them. Yes, I´m not only talking about anonymous people, I´m also talking about my neighbours, none of which are above 20. Doesn´t speak well for the future generations. 
And I´m talking about Spain, a country where gay marriage is legalized. I can´t imagine how bad it must be in places like Russia. In a world like this I can understand how some people want to fight for their right to have a normal life. A life where you can walk on the street without the fear of being called things or worse just because you have a different sexual taste than other people. 
Once everyone in the world accepts my private life I will shut up, not a second before.

Why not? Or should gay characters be shut off in to special 'gay games' for all the gays to enjoy without making your stomach turn??? 

Because I just want to play a !@#$ing game. There are a million places on the internet for you to do your SJWing. WoW doesn't need to be one of them, and FYI, I've been in a gay relationship for the past 4 years.

-------------------

http://www.wowhead.com/item=108649/a-steamy-romance-novel-savage-passions 

There is one of those Steamy romance novels for gays, found in WoW. Enjoy.

-------------------

To be honest i don't see any problem about this idea. I am Gay to, and my char looks gay as well just as i am :D so it's fine. And BTW the Male BloodElf characters already looks like gays, that's why they calld Gay Elfs :D. And I'm quiet sure aour aliance King is both have some gay issues as well :D Doesn't matter he hase a child. Yes it's a fantasy world and that's why it can works this idea, no rules, no lines, beyond in your imagination, evriething is posible, and that's why we love The World Of Warcraft :) Let's add Le.sb.ia.ns, G,a,y,s, b,i,s,e,x,u,a,l, characters as well :D It's fine, just make them a separeted Zone :D like an Island :D Called Over The Rainbow :D 

PS: Use The Blood Elf Male /silly command and you'll finde this sentence : Don't you Wish your Girl friend was hot like me? This is definitely gay :D

-------------------

I'm gay and OP's idea is plain stupid... Leave sexuality and romance out of the game please.

-------------------

! I personally think that it is impossible in a way to add gay NPC''s into the game without making it some caricature of gays or without it "shoving it into the players face", with this I mean saying stuff like "I'm gay!" or some horrendous romantic scene (I find any romantic scene wheter it be straight, gay or whatever horrendous). 

Besides, I find topics like this a VERY, VERY hard topic to discuss as is with most social issues. On one side, I can sympathise with you since you want a character to relate to on the other side I can feel that people dont want to have it in the game (be it religious motives, personal preference) and they have the right to think that. 

Personally, I think this shouldnt be added in the game or a main focus in the game industry. The reason why is because it becomes a mandatory thing game developers have to implement and it will just end up as the "that one coloured person we put in so the minority of whatever group we inteded to aim X medium at doesnt feel left out" which defeats the whole purpose. 

Like I said social issues like these are hard topics and can cause a massive sh*tstorm, even now im struggeling to make my point come across clear enough and I already have a light headache. 

In the end we all just want to play a game and we dont care if a character is gay,straight black, blue, purple, mutated or whatever. 

Let games be games, just like how movies are movies or songs are songs. Social issues dont belong in games and should be left to be discussed in real everday society. 

I hope I explained my point as best as possible. 

edit: apperently the "normal" terms to adress straight and gay is censored.

-------------------

I'm gay. I play a Night Elf Male. Night elfs are gay :P Especially pink ones xD 

That said, what is wrong with OP? Just because I'm gay I have to play a Camp character? What makes you think all the characters in wow are straight? Just because you don't get to see them in the bedroom? 

Very odd. But I agree I've yet to see any steriotypical camp gay characters in wow. Except for my Night Elf Male :P 

Edit: Don't you think the woman in the Garrison behind the missions desk is a little bit masculine? xD

-------------------

Everyone is a gay nowadays. 

I M GAY. 

I don't want any npcs related to my orientation. I have enough gays in my real life. 

I M GAY. 

I m not special. 

Frodo and Sam are gays to, i wish them to be gays. And i love that Tolkien haven't stated that they are gays or they are not gays. Because i want my fantasy flow. 

Sometimes when i look on Arthas and Fordring i let my imagination flow and draw them as Gays. 

Thanks.

-------------------

This community is that vile at times, I really think if people where to make gay chars they would be an onslaught of abuse aimed at them. 

You realize you are advocating a "don't ask don't tell" policy here right? 

What if your son turned out to be gay? Would you tell him to keep it to himself because of all the abuse he might get for it? 

Don't get me wrong I get where you're coming from. I just don't agree. 

Look at the number of threads about LFD AND LFG, I was abused kicked and so forth... Do we really need to fuel the fire for these people any more ??

You have an anime named 'Akame Ga Kill!' with a character in it named Bulat. 
He was a really awesome guy and turned out to be gay as one of the members told a new member (the lead character), they did him real well as there was nothing cliche, stupid or flamboyant about him and he was just one of the leading fighters who happened to be a pretty awesome one too. 
That is how I like it done, no weird joke type of personality, just one of the guys who happens to be gay, simple. 

Exactly. 

The best way to do such a thing in a WoW context would be to have a bit of a love-story questchain where one character asks you to help find if the guy is into her. And when you get around to asking the guy he would casually go "Ah, yeah, sorry no, I don't swing that way." 

Point is, though, why would there be such a quest in this game? For what reason? 

If it's just for the sake of showing gayness is okay it becomes little more than a contrived political statement, and not something natural. 

It's a peculiar dilemma: Asking why a character 'should be gay' is the same as asking why his hair should be black: No reason, it's just a random choice the designer makes. 

But it has no relevance at all, it isn't a big deal to emphasize because it ISN'T a big deal to begin with. 

I maintain that it would have been cool if they had done the same with Thrall, at one point or whatever have it be known that he was actually gay. 

But you shouldn't expect such things given the immature audience this game is aimed at. It's too advanced a topic to deal with in a game about death and murder and war.

-------------------

Wouldnt that quest thing just defeat the whole purpose? Its like I said in my post " "that one coloured person we put in so the minority of whatever group we inteded to aim X medium at doesnt feel left out". It would feel forced and unnatural. 

Should we also make quests about info about the holocaust, quests about showing that war isnt oke, violence isnt oke, quests with "look we also have coloured folks in our game!"?

-------------------

For all you know, most of the characters in WoW could be gay. I know OP you might be gay, so surely you can understand that gay people are normal, they don't all stand around wearing pink shouting "Fabulous!".

XDDD Can't stop laughing :D XDDD

-------------------

Yes, gay characters need to be forced down our throats. 

Being gay is like being dark-haired, it's completely normal in any fantasy setting. And no author should have the right to write stories without gay people involved in them. 

Great idea, nothing to do with you thinking your sexuality is at the centre of everyone's concern and should be forcefully and repeatedly slapped into the faces of other gamers. 

Lord of the rings should be re-written with some random gay scene between Gimli and Legolas - oh, and Aragorn should be a black woman. Because fiction has to fit with your political whims.

Frodo and Sam are gays to, i wish them to be gays. And i love that Tolkien haven't stated that they are gays or they are not gays. Because i want my fantasy flow. 

Cause Sam wasn't head over heels for that waitress chick, that he eventually married and had a bu**load of kids with...?

Frodo was his first and only love, Frodo told Sam to have kids. So he did it, with a help of Gay Gendalf mentor ofcource.

Don't really care either way. I just hope that gay NPCs don't talk about it. You know, like all the other NPCs... 

Good Quest Text: I'm starving, go pick 10 apples. 
Bad Quest Text: I'm gay, but also starving. Go pick 10 apples. 

For all you know, Blizzard already added hundreds of gay NPCs that actually behave just like the majority of people in real life do - not being obnoxious about things that don't really pertain to strangers going around killing stuff.

-------------------

How would you suggest to blend it in with a lore? I mean, for everyone to know that this specific NPC/character is gay, blizzard would literally have to add some text/motion which states 'hey I'm gay'. And I think such things would just destroy immersion. None of the characters in the game talk about their sexuality or what are they attracted to, so why suddenly add one? If you like, you can imagine that 97% of all NPCs existing already are gays, because nobody knows if they are/are not and you could just add your own imagination - problem solved.

the blood elf in the badlands quest was gay

-------------------

I am certainly no homophobe and have gay family members and friends. But let's consider something for a moment, as other people have said sexuality has no place in a game where the age range is 12+. Trying to explain someone's sexuality to a 12 year old is the same as asking them to understand political issues. 

I'm also wondering why you make such an issue out of the sexuality of pixelated NPC's in a game where storylines have nothing to do with who's engaging in coitus with who. Yes, there's procreation, and the game focuses on characters like sons and daugthers whose legacy is defined by their parents sometimes. That's normal for an MMO. 

What isn't normal is expecting that your sexuality be included in a neutral game, meant for fun and not sex. When I play WoW I don't sit there thinking to myself "Oh, this character is clearly !@#$%^-*!@#$/gay/bi-sexual!". I'm wondering if you would also consider the game to be racist due to the fact that there clearly isn't any Finnish, German, Mexican NPC's. I mean come on, where does it end? o.O 

My advice, play the game the way YOU want to, believe what you want, see the NPC's how you'd like, and just have fun. Don't spend so much time worrying about whether or not NPC 01 is engaged in a %^-*!@#$%^ relationship with NPC 02. And, don't force your views on millions of people as we don't force ours on you.

-------------------

I'm not gay but I'm playing females characters because this has nothing to do with my sexuality and you want to bring this as a preference to the game? I think it's retarded. 

Not to mention that it would flag gays to some extent and might do the opposite than you think. 

P.S. if you want to educate people about it there are better ways to do it, this isn't the place, just saying.

The meanings of to: 
Murder and to kill is Taught from a young age in schools, To be Gay isn't, There is a difference, Or do I have to give you an education as to which is the worse of the two hence why they deal with it early, Along side bullying and other forms of physical violence. 

The Government has spent a great deal of our taxes teaching our children to be expressive, To state when someone wrongs them and what is and is not acceptable, This also compliments the multi cultural diversity being taught along side this current framework. sexual diversity follows at a later age. 

This is to complement the physcosexual development of the given child within todays modern society and to teach them about rejection and acceptance. Within a lawful framework of guided learning. 

A computer game is not such a place, For sexual teaching whether it be preference or the act of.

You realize you are advocating a "don't ask don't tell" policy here right? 

Actually your wrong, I am stating I don't need to know your preference of whether you prefer same sex or different sex relationships, That doesn't matter, it doesn't make you, Any different to what you where five minutes ago. 

And the reason some Gay people have issues is narrow minded people that always jump to their defence making them into special snow flakes, Ramming Gay rights or in some cases coloureds(Both black and white) rights down peoples throats. 
This leads to Tensions amongst the differences in life or the choices people make, How are we ever going to live in harmony, If bygons are not left to settle, The 1980's and 90s where such times of gays rights. Self expression is also a right, It is how we use that right that becomes illegal, Immoral, Or mere opinion.

I'll probably get shot down for this - but I was wondering why WoW has no gay characters? Gays play the game too, and it's the 21st Century and all. 

A lot of young people play the game, and it'd make a good impression, and help people be more accepting in everyday life. 

Yes, I'm gay, and don't really care about the homophobes, but think WoW would be doing themselves a service if they implemented a character into the game which is gay.

there's two NPCs in the Alliance Shrine flirting with each other too.. 

so while there are examples, they aren't having a parade thru Stormwind, it's subtle and understated, you just have to open your eyes and see (or google search as this is a topic that's been around for ages and ages)

No. 

As has already been stated repeatedly, as an example, they would just have a regular NPC who asks you to do something to help their BF, GF, husband, or wife, who you then realise (if you notice at all) is the same gender as them. 

Nothing is mentioned about them being gay, just as nothing is mentioned about other NPCs, who ask you to help their significant other, being straight. 

That's how they do it in ESO anyway and it seems to work fine there. 

I didn't even hear anyone referring to it, on chat, or anything - so, apparently they didn't notice, or didn't mind.

-------------------

Holy !@#$ i've never seen a post with so many dislikes. Also because it's so irrelevant to the game since Sex is already not a part of the game.

-------------------

I'm all for some gay characters (Male or Female) in this game, but could we give them funny quotes.

-------------------

@ 4d3fbf3074fbb08b: 

My point rather being, I find it odd that people are more concerned about the depiction of gays in a game than the depiction of violence in it, considering the latter is obviously more abhorrent. 

That said I do agree I see no point in depicting such characters when it is not particularly relevant, but that's a bit of paradox. As said, a character's sexual orientation is just about the same as their haircolour or skincolour: It's one random trait that may not have any particular significance or influence on the story or their development at all, and when used for the sake of making it a topic to raise awareness, it just becomes contrived.. 

As for the second part of your message, I would argue there's a strong difference between "Not mentioning it because it is not relevant to mention" and "not mentioning it out of fear of ridicule and abuse", the latter being what your post was advocating if I read it right. Hence my disagreement with it. 

That said I agree that someone randomly stating "hey guys, I'm gay" is about as stupid and pointless as someone saying "hey guys I'm straight".

-------------------

I'd hate to see this in the game to fulfill some sort of senseless quotas. 

You know what shoehorning things like this into stories makes? Bad writing. 

Would Romeo and Juliet be better if there was a gay character involved? Probably not. 

If Blizz feels like it, have at it! 
I don't care as long as it's done well. Make the character fit into the story so it makes sense. As far as Warcraft goes, in most stories one's sexuality is not relevant in any way whatsoever. 

And going through this thread, I see it is probably already present in some form. 

However, there is literally no reason to go out of your way as a developer to make things like this if you don't want to. It is 
their world.

Well I think the title of the game is a real give away to most, "WARCRAFT" violence and killing, But that said: (actually said to lighten things up) 

I have been able to teach mine to hurt others is unacceptable, And that sometimes not everyone is as nice as them. And at times their not as nice as some people would like them to be, it is part of life. it has helped to separate fact from fiction. 

It has helped greatly with forming opinions theory and planning. Along side other basic skills like maths and English, Even some art lessons in there, Little lad loves dragons and has a thing for Onyxia. 

The problem we have with violence Turn any news channel on and what do you see and hear about ? 

Pain, suffering and death with and without the violence, Why it sells news and the more they beef it up the higher the ratings. 

It is human nature to be like this, Sad but true .

I refuse to eat meat in this game unless it is halal certified. Pls implement that too.

I tell you something. I have no problem with someone being gay or part of other sexual minority. But i have problem with ppl that keep demaning attention about their sexual orientation. Making marches etc. is annoying and calling it "pride"... Pride for what? For being part of minority, so we mayority are inferior or what?

-------------------

To be honest, I do not understand why gay characters would need to be added. And I mean "clearly" gay, who say it straight out or something. I mean, how do you know if a character is gay or straight, it's not like they say it in every conversation? "Hi, want to buy a JC recipe? Btw I'm straight" or "Hi, want to learn fishing? I'm gay btw". I agree with those saying sexuality doesn't belong to this game, leave the characters as they are. Most likely there are some characters who are gay, they just don't have the need to announce it to a random stranger passing by.

-------------------

I think the biggest problem with this thread is that people see the word 'gay' and turn it into something explicit and in-your-face. 

It's not a big ask really. Throwing in a few more speaking npcs that are the same gender and married/dating (perhaps quest givers) really isn't as huge, crazy, or different from many hetrosexual npcs. People aren't asking for kissy-kissy scenes or anything like that at all, just the slight nod in recognition that they can exist in what we imagine as our fantasy world. We can imagine a boy and girl being together in warcraft- really, why not anything else? Why is this considered so game-breaking? 

It's not something 12 year-olds can't see either- it's not explicit, it's just two darn npcs with the same last name, that are the same gender! There are a growing number of children with parents that are the same gender, and they seem to manage just fine without being scarred deeply by the knowledge. 

Why do people care so much -not- to involve others? 

The fact that people have to ask to be included in a game sort of says it all.

-------------------

There are several gay characters ingame already. They don't state it, but it's obvious from the conversation.

-------------------

Since they are stealing everything anyway, they may as well look at guildwars2 how it is done respectfully. It's not even a thing there, it just is. 

But seeing how it took ten years to get a proper female ingame (draka, yay! and the conversation with thrall... did they finally get it at blizz HQ?) I don't think you should get your hopes up high. 

Worst thing would be if they actually make a robed male belf the first openly gay character ingame :(. In that case I'm afraid it'll take them another 10 years to understand how wrong that is. 

I suggest blizzard asks Stephen Fry to voice the first openly gay character in warcraft :). That would have a nice background and he must be the cuddliest man on earth.

This is exactly what would be wrong. It shouldn't be obvious at all, that's the point. It shouldn't be a thing, it should just be. Normal people don't go out in the streets shouting how gay or straight they are, they go to work, do their job, and when they come home they come home to their love, whoever that is. If that turns out to be a male or a female is all that decides it, nothing else. 

Don't believe what you see on tv: it's grossly overdone.

I don't think it would fit in the game looking how some subjects are portrayed rather comical. 
Last thing we want is another reason for people to make fun of them. 

If it's done tastefully, then I see no issue. 
Even though I could understand what you're saying, there's not that much diversity in the wow human race as it is either. Do you see other skin colors than just different shades of white? Do you see anything but churches and chapels? I say we need mosques and synagogues in wow! 

How do you know there are no gay wow characters currently? I've never seen a marriage licence or characters of the opposing sex making out? I'd think it would be quite discriminating if they would make characters stereotypical gays. How would a tasteful gay be characterized? 

On a more trolly note, I think you're discriminating for saying none of the wow characters are gay. You truly hurt young Anduin's heart.

I didn't even read most of the comments, but the main idea seems retarded to me, why? 
1st of all I have no problems with gay people. 
Thing is , if you go around in our wonderful real life, and you see gay people, you may see something different like clothes, piercings, tatts, and the atitude/character. 
THEY ARE NO friggin dif , they still have what we all guys have , its the way they are acting/dressing etc. 
ea : In wow you can be gay with a human if you get them gears to be pink ( sort of speak , again , whatever floats ur boat as a gay dude ) , but you can't say that gay people have something in + , so its retarded to think that in wow a dwarf or a human can be dif if gay or not from a developing point of view.

Making marches etc. is annoying and calling it "pride"... Pride for what? For being part of minority, so we mayority are inferior or what? 

To tell the truth I also think those marches are over the top and represent the worst gay stereotypes most conservative people have, which is far from a good idea. The original idea behind them, though, was to show the world gay people are no different and deserve to be treated just like any ordinary person, since they are ordinary persons after all. What you do in your private life should be of no one´s concern. 

On this thread you can see a couple of these examples, and I´m not sure all of them are trolls: people that force their values on you and judge you as a person based on something that doesn´t affect their lives at all, calling you things and feeling superior just because you love someone from the same sex as you. 

So I find it perfectly OK that people manifest themselves and rise up to demand to be treated equally and without judgement from conservative people. But as I said, doing it by showing themselves as special and different they are undermining their claims. Your sexual orientation shouldn´t make you worse or better than anyone.

It runs a little deeper than that, though. Gay Pride is also standing in defiance against festivals that, in the past, catered exclusively to straight couples. For example, any fare you go to, you will see stalls about romance, etc. But those are (were, in progressive countries) catering exclusively to straight couple, and gays would be frowned upon, or downright shown the door. 

Not saying I endorse the overt flamboyance of Pride, but I do understand, and support the idea behind it.

Unfortunately, I find them far worse than mere trolls. Conservatism with such fervor has been the cause of great injustices in the past, and it needs to be actively opposed, in my opinion. I have no problem with the guy who feels that it is ungodly, but keeps it to himself. But a lot doesn't, and a lot of people have suffered due to that.

im guessing that the marches that happen HAVE to be eye catching to make people notice. 
the trouble then is that a lot of people see it as being a vehicle to ask for more...they want more media spotlight, if they wanted to be the same, they should just be the same" 

i agree on both counts.....it IS more media grabbing, but it always will be at first...they feel they need to catch the public eye and make them aware of discrimination that still happens (not just gay people by the way) 
ONCE things change, then of course, people will drop into the back ground.....but it needs to be forefront to make people sit up. 

i personally dont like any kind of protest march....i feel people should protest in other ways...if a government isnt liked...vote them out, dont protest about them.....if a rule or law is unjust, campaign to have it changed using politicians and public support, but dont have a march about it etc etc 

but anyway - back on topic firmly.....the op is falling under the above *trap* - he has to be out there and making his point of view known - so he can get the sameness he wants.....and like ive said earlier, theres nothing wrong in having gay/bi or whatever sexuality in game, as long as its as subtle, but pervasive as heter0 relationships are represented.....and they ARE everywhere in game.

Because there's no need for sexuality to be in the game at all. 

You can add Race(in game races excluded), Religion and Political views. 
It doesn't matter if your male, female, gay, straight, red, green or blue. 
What should matter is if your a friendly player or not.

respectfully and tastefully.. Like how female/male dichotomy has been so tastefully handled? Big boobs vs Big shoulders and so on? Would most likely mean lots more lovely stereotypes.

Even though I could understand what you're saying, there's not that much diversity in the wow human race as it is either. Do you see other skin colors than just different shades of white? Do you see anything but churches and chapels? I say we need mosques and synagogues in wow! 

How do you know there are no gay wow characters currently? I've never seen a marriage licence or characters of the opposing sex making out? I'd think it would be quite discriminating if they would make characters stereotypical gays. How would a tasteful gay be characterized? 

On a more trolly note, I think you're discriminating for saying none of the wow characters are gay. You truly hurt young Anduin's heart. 

The wow universe is kinda set up like this: 

Humans are the default white western male or maybe lets say, priviliged white male american christian republian in the states (or how some percieve this stereotypical default setting to be). Im not going to deep into this, just saying how it is stereotypically portrayed. 

Dwarves are the Scottish, irish culture, still christians. 

Gnomes they are just weird. 

Night elves They are kind of like either japanese or turks, so either they represent the japanese culture and religion or muslim faith, culture, not sure. Im thinking its more Japanese though. 

Blood elves Seems alot like they are based off persian culture or something of the sort, so it would be the culture and religion of that . 

Pandaren are obviously based off chinese culture and buddhism. 

Ok ill stop there but my point is that most cultures and religions are already represented in the game. Adressing the part you spoke about "I say we need mosques and synagogues in wow!" 

Do you understand what im trying to say? Like, its been done, but in a fantasy kind of way already.

I vote for no gays in World of Warcraft.

Well as people have already said, there are subtle hints at gay characters already in the game. I dont see why Blizzard should pander to those calling for this, after all only about 1% of people are actually gay.

Ok i am gay and this is the reason we get hated on so god damn much. 

P.S There is a gay realm on the US version (mostly gay people).

THIS. 

Totally agree.

there isn't one already, EU is more pro gay, Sweden, Norway etc.

I agree with you. should be fine and nice for the gay community to have their own realm :) and im certanly transoprt my char for there.

I wouldn't want gay characters in WoW. There's just absolutely no need for 
it. Its a fantasy RPG game and there's no need to sexualise a game, even

That's a terrible idea. I mean what exactly is the benefit of corralling a 
bunch of gay players to their own realm? It's got huge unfortunate 
implications anyhow, plus the majority of gay players are just going to 
stay on their current realm where all their friends and guild members are. 
-Plus- it would just encouraging trolls to make characters there and be 
massively homophobic.Seriously, what are -any- of the plus points 
of having a realm for gay people?

I wouldn't want gay characters in WoW. There's just absolutely no need 
for it. Its a fantasy RPG game and there's no need to sexualise a game, 
even more so that certain transmogs.

You haven't played many fantasy RPG's have you? Spoilers ahead.Final 
Fantasy VII - one of the most critical acclaimed fantasy RPG's 
had the main character crossdress to get information. He got the clothes 
from a gym full of muscular guys with strong gay innuendos.Baldur's 
Gate 2 - lets you sleep with characters of your own gender in a 
brothel.Skyrim - Same sex relationships all over. 
Have sex with everything.Mass Effect series - 
Lets you have relationships with an alien species where same sex 
partnerships is normal.Dragon Age series - no one 
cares. The Blight is ruining everything. Have sex with whoever you want.Persona 
- one of the best written gay characters is in this series. There isn't 
any sex. Only a character struggling to come to terms with his own 
sexuality.Guild Wars 2 - 3 of the main 
protagonists are lesbians. A race called the Sylvari (plant species) does 
not reproduce conventionaly, but are grown from the great tree in their 
homeland. Thus conventional reproductive relationships are strange to them.Grand 
Theft Auto - The Ballad of Gay Tony - One of the protagonists 
"Gay Tony" Prince, is bi-sexual.The Walking 
Dead: The Game Season Two - The protagonist meets a gay couple 
who is trying to survive the zombie apocalypse.Fallout: 
New Vegas - has an openly lesbian follower who left her Templar 
order, because her parents dissaproved of her relationships.The 
Secret World (MMORPG) - has gay characters in all staring areas 
of the the 3 factions. One of them clearly states it, while the other has 
pictures of her partner on her working desk.The Last of Us 
- Bill - a supporting character is gay. It is never told directly, but it 
is pointed out during the way the player interact with him. A perfect 
example as to how gay characters can be included in games.BioShock 
- The underwater city of Rapture did not condemn same sex relationships 
due to the citys ultra-liberal policies.Some of these titles have 
achieved highly if not iconic status as games. Why? They were great games, 
that besides being great and fun to play, weren't afraid to treat their 
audience like adults and integrate same sex relationships in a respectable 
manner.

-------------------

Adding gay characters to your IP is pointless, I've never seen anyone actually have a legitimate reason for making someone gay. Just saying "oh yeah, that dude is gay" does not make him gay, it's just the flavor of the month and so you added it to get some extra credit. Great, now what? 

Dumbledore being gay? It added nothing to his character. Rowling just added it because accepting gay was the cool thing to do. 

Sure blizzard could add a gay character, but it would have to actually mean something, influence the character, change them. 
I don't think you could do that in a 12+ game.

-------------------

There's a much simpler answer to this question and it's that WoW is a global game played all over the world, but unfortunately !@#$%^-*!@ity is not treated as equally in all countries. You'd be surprised. If WoW started to include and openly support #$%^-*!@#$ity then that would likely have consequences for the game's playability in some countries. 

I don't feel like Blizzard is doing an injustice by not including %^-*!@#$%^ity either. I actually respect how much they want to promote equality, such as the perfect balance between the sexes in the game (almost all guards spawn as either gender for instance). Maybe in ten years you will start seeing -*!@#$%^-*ity treated as fair. 

Edit: Nvm, my respect for Blizzard just went down by miles since they've filtered the word h-sexuality. What the !@#$ is wrong with your forum.

I'll probably get shot down for this - but I was wondering why WoW has no gay characters? Gays play the game too, and it's the 21st Century and all. 

A lot of young people play the game, and it'd make a good impression, and help people be more accepting in everyday life. 

Yes, I'm gay, and don't really care about the homophobes, but think WoW would be doing themselves a service if they implemented a character into the game which is gay. 

I haven't read the replies,so here is my 2 pence on the matter,why is this even an issue? I don't understand people's fixation sexual orientation,& why it needs to be broadcast to the whole world! What you get up to in the bedroom department & with whom is really nobodies business but your own

You missunderstod me, this is just an option, because we don't want any

realm like this, ofc we can play with each other in the world of azeroth. 
for sure i don't want be separet form other players. But not many of them 
so open minded about shuch a things like this you know. plus adding 
something like this doesn't means NASTY. Sexuality is not a nasty thing, 
pleople makes it nasty, not the words it self.

-------------------

I support this idea in theory. Just not sure how it would or could be implemented. My first reaction was that Thrall should be gay, but he is already married. So, hmm, maybe a quest where Anduin and Wrynn fall in love or something. Like lets say, if it is valentines day event, there would be a quest that involved Anduin and Wrathion falling in love? Or maybe Jaina and some other woman (can't think of any right now). 

Well, anyway I support the idea of it. Oh and I want to say, why so many dislikes for the OP. It just makes me think we need this even more if people are gonna hate on him for being "happy" or taking up new ideas.

to those calling for this, after all only about 1% of people are 
actually gay.

It is 10% actually.And I don't see why Blizzard should pander to 
ho-mophobes either.

No it's not, that myth was dispelled a long time ago when this kind of 
information started to be collected on large scale surveys and Census.The 
reality is its only about 1%.Blizzard aren't pandering to 
ho-mophobes, they made a game, which already has some ho-mosexual 
characters, and people are complaining because whatever minority they 
belong to aren't 'represented'. I say stop complaining about something 
that doesn't even matter. I mean are people so insecure about their 
sexuality that they need to see loads of people like them in every game 
they play?

-------------------

The fact of the matter is, if they did that it would take away the fact this game is a fantasy world, as pointed sexuality is never discussed it is just assumed, so there really is no need nor requirement for it to be implemented in game. 

But if they did then why not every other type of weird and wonderful lifestyle choices that are out there, it would probably open up the flood gates on every group that plays wow. 

One of my work colleagues is gay, and he often says he feels that there is no need to have his sexuality shouted out from the "top's of buildings", he knows who he is and so do his family and close friends, it would make no difference to his life if the entire world new who and what he was. 

So for me keep sexuality as ambiguous as it is now, it really does not "add" any depth to the game. 

Do take care and I wish you happiness in your life.

At the end of the day an angry orc/human (race) wielding an axe can be any sexual orientation... imo, it simply doesn't matter as long as the current way things are portrayed it doesn't cause distress or offence to the players :)

I get what you are saying. But look here is the way I see it. This game was made more than 10 years ago, things have changed since then. Like someone listed a bit back in the thread, there are whole lot of games today where they have put this in, just to make a stand. Being all neutral works if you don't want to offend the.. who? Yeah, I think you know who would be "offended" if wow actively took the fight and put in some happy characters. Should we care about those kind of people and what they are offended about and pander to them? I mean if you really have nothing against happy people why care or be offended if Blizzard decides to support through the game. 

There is a fight for the rights of happy people, even today. Just look at some of the laws in russia and other countrys for example. You can just sit back and be neutral or take up the shield, armour and string the bow, bring forth that mighty battle axe and take up the fight.

I second this 100%.Having different sexual tastes does not in any way 
alter your physical or social appearance. Who you go to bed with is your 
choice and your choice alone, in the sense it shouldn't concern anybody 
else.This thread is bad and the only purpose for it is really just the

Because some people will might be think the gayness can influence their child. Wich is not true at all. I saw that manytimes in tv, in real, read about it, ect... And they fear this can be modify their sexual orrientacion out of shape, wich is both not true, if you all read the article what that sexy orc linked in the forum above us. It tells much about the sexual orientacion. But what it doesn't mention, is the people fear, or call it what ever you want. Wich is actualy sometimes makes it quiet hard to them to face this. And ofc we al have to agree the computer games could be atracting the childs behiviors as well. You probably heard, or read about many articles about: This child, or guy died when they palyed wow. Now think of it how could it be seen such an article like this looking: A 12 years old Child became gay while played wow. Wich is doesn't makes any sense at all, cos if you have read that article in that wikipedia link above us, you can understand the whole whole sexuality. And that makes it clear it isn't connected with the game. It is based on the people point of view, and their opend mind. For those who can accsept the different sexual orientation, they don't care about this, and they both dosen't see any problem about this. But notice this is not meaning evrie body hase the same point of view in this topic. In my opion, This is surly not gonna harm anybody if it stays in the line.

No it's not, that myth was dispelled a long time ago when this kind of 
information started to be collected on large scale surveys and Census.The 
reality is its only about 1%.

1% on average isn't true. Do your research. The numbers are higher even in 
recent censuses.First of all the 10% was conceived by Kinsey 
during his research on sexual behaviour in american men and women. However 
later research has show that the number vary from area to area and from 
country to country.While it is true that some censuses have 
conceived the number around as low as 0,8% those numbers have been 
calculated in certain countries and areas where people do not perceive 
!@#$%^-*!@ity as normal. If you look at the american census there were 
apparantly a lot more gays and lesbians on the east and west coast in the 
US, who tend to be more liberal towards LGBT people.This means 
that these kinds of censuses have a margin of error that is locally and 
culturally dictated. Some people are either in denial or won't tell anyone 
about it at all.These numbers have the methodical errors of first 
of all relying on the participants replying in honesty. This is shown in 
the numbers of mostly young people tend to admit that they were gay or 
lesbian, while elder people apparantly weren't gay at all.Secondly 
they don't take yearly development into account. As in how would things 
look if you asked the same people a few years after. It is not uncommon 
for gay people to wait ages to come out of the closet.From a 
cultural perspective this makes sense, as younger generations has been 
more open and inclined to openly identiy as gay, lesbian or bi due to 
progress made in the area. However these censuses does not take into 
account:1. People who outright lied in the census.2. Closeted 
gay or lesbians3. Lack of knowledge as to what it means to be gay or 
lesbian (aka. the recipient don't understand what is being asked. Almost 
2% replied "Other" and 2% "Don't know" in the Williams Institute survey of 
american sexual identity).If you look at censuses where 
#$%^-*!@#$ity was much more accepted, the numbers went as high as 4% - not 
counting bi-sexuals and transgender.Aditionally each survey has 
proven to having a higher amount of people identifying as gay the longer 
into the 2000 we get. Not surprising the number rise as high as 3% average 
in 2011-2014All of these numbers are of course not including the 
amount of people who identify as bi-sexual, whom were also a part of 
Kinseys original number of 10%. Once you do that. Numbers vary from 
between 9-15% in various countries.This has led to believe that 
while Kinseys numbers might have been high to begin with, there is no 
final conclusion that they aren't correct either. The major issue here is 
that these kinds of demographic surveys are hard to make because the rely 
on the honesty of the participant on a very personal subject. The human 
mind is complicated, and that is very hard to use in an conclusive argumentWhich 
leads me to my final point:So while 1% is a convenient low number 
to pull for the sake of argument, it is not entirely correct. Also it 
still does not give any legitimacy to the arguement that because the 
people who play a game is low, there shouldn't be some kind of inclusion. 
First of all you have no idea if your perceived number is true when it 
comes to the WoW demographic, and secondly out of a player base of 10 
million players, we are talking 100,000 of the subscriber base which is 
pretty much a substantial amount of people (if we use your number).Also 
you are making the assumption that all straight people won't see the 
inclusion of gay characters in the game. This is far from 
the truth and from your argument you make it sound like only 1% of the 
player base wants this. If you read this thread you would see that some 
people who I presume are straight argue more for gay representation than 
those who identify as gay.In conclusion - while 
your number hold some merit it is not enough to use as an statistical 
argument against gay characters in WoW. Simply due to the fact that the 
numbers aren't accurate and that the number might not even apply to the 
WoW demographic.And the part about %^-*-phobes.You are in 
no position to tell people what should or should not matter to them. 
Secondly if you are not gay, you are in no position to tell gay people how 
they should or should not feel about a subject. Because something does not 
matter to you, doesn't make it less of a subject for the 
people interested in it.No if it TRULY didn't matter you wouldn't

...It is 10% actually.And I 
don't see why Blizzard should pander to ho-mophobes either.

No it's not, that myth was dispelled a long time ago when this kind of 
information started to be collected on large scale surveys and Census.The 
reality is its only about 1%.

1% on average isn't true. Do your research. The numbers are higher even in 
recent censuses.First of all the 10% was conceived by Kinsey 
during his research on sexual behaviour in american men and women. However 
later research has show that the number vary from area to area and from 
country to country.While it is true that some censuses have 
conceived the number around as low as 0,8% those numbers have been 
calculated in certain countries and areas where people do not perceive 
!@#$%^-*!@ity as normal. If you look at the american census there were 
apparantly a lot more gays and lesbians on the east and west coast in the 
US, who tend to be more liberal towards LGBT people.This means 
that these kinds of censuses have a margin of error that is locally and 
culturally dictated. Some people are either in denial or won't tell anyone 
about it at all.These numbers have the methodical errors of first 
of all relying on the participants replying in honesty. This is shown in 
the numbers of mostly young people tend to admit that they were gay or 
lesbian, while elder people apparantly weren't gay at all.Secondly 
they don't take yearly development into account. As in how would things 
look if you asked the same people a few years after. It is not uncommon 
for gay people to wait ages to come out of the closet.From a 
cultural perspective this makes sense, as younger generations has been 
more open and inclined to openly identiy as gay, lesbian or bi due to 
progress made in the area. However these censuses does not take into 
account:1. People who outright lied in the census.2. Closeted 
gay or lesbians3. Lack of knowledge as to what it means to be gay or 
lesbian (aka. the recipient don't understand what is being asked. Almost 
2% replied "Other" and 2% "Don't know" in the Williams Institute survey of 
american sexual identity).If you look at censuses where 
#$%^-*!@#$ity was much more accepted, the numbers went as high as 4% - not 
counting bi-sexuals and transgender.Aditionally each survey has 
proven to having a higher amount of people identifying as gay the longer 
into the 2000 we get. Not surprising the number rise as high as 3% average 
in 2011-2014All of these numbers are of course not including the 
amount of people who identify as bi-sexual, whom were also a part of 
Kinseys original number of 10%. Once you do that. Numbers vary from 
between 9-15% in various countries.This has led to believe that 
while Kinseys numbers might have been high to begin with, there is no 
final conclusion that they aren't correct either. The major issue here is 
that these kinds of demographic surveys are hard to make because the rely 
on the honesty of the participant on a very personal subject. The human 
mind is complicated, and that is very hard to use in an conclusive argumentWhich 
leads me to my final point:So while 1% is a convenient low number 
to pull for the sake of argument, it is not entirely correct. Also it 
still does not give any legitimacy to the arguement that because the 
people who play a game is low, there shouldn't be some kind of inclusion. 
First of all you have no idea if your perceived number is true when it 
comes to the WoW demographic, and secondly out of a player base of 10 
million players, we are talking 100,000 of the subscriber base which is 
pretty much a substantial amount of people (if we use your number).Also 
you are making the assumption that all straight people won't see the 
inclusion of gay characters in the game. This is far from 
the truth and from your argument you make it sound like only 1% of the 
player base wants this. If you read this thread you would see that some 
people who I presume are straight argue more for gay representation than 
those who identify as gay.In conclusion - while 
your number hold some merit it is not enough to use as an statistical 
argument against gay characters in WoW. Simply due to the fact that the 
numbers aren't accurate and that the number might not even apply to the 
WoW demographic.And the part about %^-*-phobes.You are in 
no position to tell people what should or should not matter to them. 
Secondly if you are not gay, you are in no position to tell gay people how 
they should or should not feel about a subject. Because something does not 
matter to you, doesn't make it less of a subject for the 
people interested in it.No if it TRULY didn't matter you wouldn't 
be here arguing against better representation. If it TRULY didn't matter, 
you wouldn't mind it at all.No you are here, because you felt the

-------------------

It's funny how a lot of people directly view being gay as something pure sexual, which it doesn't have to be, in fact I don't even like the word gay... As it throws romance/feelings and sexual desires into one big bucket, though the truth is that none of 'em are directly inclusive to be one with eachother. And as the game already is representing romantic scenery and motions between man and women, I truly understand why people would want to include same sex couples into the game.

Nobody freaking cares who you decide to sleep with now-a-days. Men, woman or both, just get on with the game. 

In a land called Utopia it might be so, but here on Earth some people are eager to judge their neighbours based solely on that: who they decide to sleep or live with. 
It doesn´t matter if you are a lovely person. 
It doesn´t matter if you don´t critice their lives just as they do with yours. 
It doesn´t matter if you fight for their rights as much as yours. 
If you love someone from the same sex as you you should burn in hell and they are perfectly entitled to insult you in public, since you are the sole reason their family values are downgrading to stone age levels. 

Now, while I agree adding a gay character just for the sake of it is unnecesary I wouldn´t oppose it either if it happened. It would help youngsters seeing it as a normal thing. 
Yes, I said youngsters because I think grown up people are too far gone to change their minds if they still live in the middle ages. And because they are the demographic group that more seriously need it. From the people that have insulted me in the street none of them were above 20.

apparantly a lot more gays and lesbians on the east and west coast in 
the US, who tend to be more liberal towards LGBT people.

Nonsense, here is UK household survey data from only a couple of years 
ago, gay, lesbian and bisexual only makes up 1.5%. The UK is FAR more 
liberal towards gays than the USA, which puts G&L&bi at 1-3% in most 
surveys.http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_227150.pdf

This means that these kinds of censuses have a margin of error that is 
locally and culturally dictated. Some people are either in denial or 
won't tell anyone about it at all.These numbers have the 
methodical errors of first of all relying on the participants replying 
in honesty. This is shown in the numbers of mostly young people tend to

out of the closet.From a cultural perspective this makes sense, 
as younger generations has been more open and inclined to openly identiy 
as gay, lesbian or bi due to progress made in the area. However these 
censuses does not take into account:1. People who outright lied

whom were also a part of Kinseys original number of 10%. Once you do 
that. Numbers vary from between 9-15% in various countries.This 
has led to believe that while Kinseys numbers might have been high to 
begin with, there is no final conclusion that they aren't correct 
either. The major issue here is that these kinds of demographic surveys 
are hard to make because the rely on the honesty of the participant on a 
very personal subject. The human mind is complicated, and that is very 
hard to use in an conclusive argument

You do know that all those issues are known to statisticians and there are 
a myriad of different techniques for correcting bias, such as weighting, 
which is done on all major surveys.9-15% is a ridiculous estimate 
based on nothing. You can't dismiss surveys with hundreds of thousands of 
respondents saying they are biased and just use a figure based on even 
weaker statistical methods because its more convenient for you.Everyone 
knows the 10% figure is ridiculous just by looking at the people they know 
and thinking are 10% gay...

Which leads me to my final point:So while 1% is a convenient low 
number to pull for the sake of argument, it is not entirely correct. 
Also it still does not give any legitimacy to the arguement that because 
the people who play a game is low, there shouldn't be some kind of 
inclusion. First of all you have no idea if your perceived number is 
true when it comes to the WoW demographic, and secondly out of a player 
base of 10 million players, we are talking 100,000 of the subscriber 
base which is pretty much a substantial amount of people (if we use your 
number).

Seriously, gays are ALREADY IN THE GAME, as numerous posters have shown. 
Why are you still complaining?There are more DISABLED people 
playing WoW than there are gays, yet you dont hear them calling for WOW 
characters in wheelchairs do you....

Also you are making the assumption that all straight people won't see 
the inclusion of gay characters in the game. This is far 
from the truth and from your argument you make it sound like only 1% of 
the player base wants this. If you read this thread you would see that 
some people who I presume are straight argue more for gay representation 
than those who identify as gay.

Strawman, I never said that 1% wants it, I said 1% is gay. I would bet 
most of those 1% don't give a crap.

In conclusion - while your number hold some merit it is 
not enough to use as an statistical argument against gay characters in 
WoW. Simply due to the fact that the numbers aren't accurate and that 
the number might not even apply to the WoW demographic.And the 
part about %^-*-phobes.You are in no position to tell people 
what should or should not matter to them. Secondly if you are not gay, 
you are in no position to tell gay people how they should or should not 
feel about a subject. Because something does not matter to you, 
doesn't make it less of a subject for the people interested in it.No 
if it TRULY didn't matter you wouldn't be here arguing against better 
representation. If it TRULY didn't matter, you wouldn't mind it at all.No 
you are here, because you felt the need to tell other people about YOUR 
perceived truths on THEIR problems. For some reason beyond me you need 
to defend WoW's current approach to it, with nothing else than "This 
isn't a problem" and incorrect numbers to back it up.If it 
doesn't matter. Move along sir, or admit to the fact that you just don't 
want to see gay characters in the game, for some obscure reason I'll let 
you keep to yourself.I'll even let you admit to the fact that 
you just don't like to see gay characters. In which I can at least 
respect your honesty, and just accept that you're a douche towards gay 
people.

I have nothing against gay people, people can live their lives how they 
want to. What I have a problem with is people trying to make everything 
into a gay issue, wow should do this to include gays etc. No, wow is a 
game, there's no need to stuff it with gay people just to make some people 
feel better.WOW doesn't have any Christians, Muslims, Oriental, 
Asian people either, and the list goes on and on and on.....should they 
all be shoe-horned into the game just so its 'diverse'

Male Blood Elf. 

Joking aside..... 

How would you know? 

Unless you picked up a quest and they said "by the way, i'm gay" as you walked off then you just wouldn't know. 

People just don't announce their sexual orientation for no reason whatsoever, that's just silly. 

Then there is the issue of them adding it "tastefully". 

By that I mean they would have to add it in a way that doesn't come off as cheesy or camp. 

A lot of devs don;t seem to manage the tasteful part. Closest you'd probably get is Anduin in drag singing "I Will Survive" to a bunch of sailors.

How would you know? 

Unless you picked up a quest and they said "by the way, i'm gay" as you walked off then you just wouldn't know. 

People just don't announce their sexual orientation for no reason whatsoever, that's just silly.. 

I was about to say the same. You cannot spot someone's sexual orientation by just looking at them. This thing that gay people act differently is just a thing you see on TV - it's actually not like that in real life. 

This means that the NPC would need to tell you. And for what good reason would an NPC tell you this out of nowhere?

-------------------

Yes, I'd also like to see quest chains involving: 

-Disabled character couples 
-Transgender character couples 
-Hermaphrodite character couples 
-Bisexual character couples 
-Down syndrome character couples 

Why not? These are real issues and it will send a positive message to the international community. 

I already see an epic quest chain that sends you in Black Temple's Den of Mortal delights for a group "party".

I also personally believe anduin is gay......... ;p;p 

We have never seen him say he anything of that kind. So no idea why you would think that.

-------------------

I am a straight girl. I would love to see a gay relationship as visable in wow as thrall and mrs thrall. I think it would quietly send a positive message to the community, esp the younger ones. ;p;p;p I also personally believe anduin is gay......... ;p;p

-------------------

On the subject of why the game needs it.....there are hetr0 couples in the game...so I ask this....hetr0sexualism IS represented...in marriages and couples....in quests and npcs..why NOT gay? 
Give me a simple answer without statistics to show why ONE is...and one blatantly isn't? 
Innuendo isn't the issue here....show me and IMPLICITLY gay relationship in wow and ill stop posting. 
Not...oh this guy must be gay because.....show me a quest that says "take this to my husband" and its a male q giver. (or female/female) 

On the subject of visibility...any inclusion of gay couples needs to be no more...and no less than their hetr0 counterparts.....so you would know because the male q giver asked you to find his husband..for example. 
It isn't in your face..but its IMPLICIT in the quest text. 
We can all use figures..but it looks like somewhere between 1 and 10% could be an accurate percentage to use..... 
When THAT happens then ill say its balanced.

-------------------

This game had bears and twinks for ten years.

-------------------

I'd like to see in WoW quests about blood giving because this is very socially important question and there should be some examples of it! Blood types could be attached by classes (priests have 0+, paladins 0- and so on)… 

</ironichorde>

-------------------

I have nothing against gays but come on ffs its a game keep sexuality the !@#$ out of it.

-------------------

Are you kidding me? How is a character gay? How do you design a gay character? What makes it gay? 

This must be the biggest and most useless trolling thread in General. 

Blizzard is banning people who make fun of this thread instead of locking it. 

Please enlighten me, how is this thread constructive?

I heard gamon is gay, can anybody confirm? 

The last Orc that made advances on Gamon was 'sorted out' by a group of 25 thugs and never heard of again. I'm not going to take chances, man.

Nonsense, here is UK household survey data from only a couple of years ago, gay, lesbian and bisexual only makes up 1.5%. The UK is FAR more liberal towards gays than the USA, which puts G&L&bi at 1-3% in most surveys. 

UK isn't the only country in the world, and if you studied surveys well beyond your own country, you will see that numbers differs from the numbers shown. Many of the issues I listed are methodical critiques 
performed by the very people conducting these kinds of surveys. 

In case you didn't know - methodical approach and awareness of potential error in the empirical process is key as to how you interpret your actual results. Social sciences do not have definitive answers. They can tell what they did, and what numbers they got, and each result should be handled with that awareness. If you blindly follow these kinds of results without knowing 
how and 
why they were made, you're failing the very basics of academia. You treated your number as a nature given fact, and that is not the case. No matter how much you try to argue against it. 

Which brings me to...

Strawman, I never said that 1% wants it, I said 1% is gay. I would bet most of those 1% don't give a crap. 

You said 1% is gay. That is a small amount, so Blizzard shouldn't adhere to it. They've done enough already. You made an assumption about how this only being important for potentially 1% of the player base, and I pointed out a flaw in that assumption. No strawman here. 

Now you also say you bet 1% don't give a crap. Bet all you want. Still doesn't make it valid to be treated as a fact. But you are of course free to believe what you want.

Seriously, gays are ALREADY IN THE GAME, as numerous posters have shown. Why are you still complaining? 

There are more DISABLED people playing WoW than there are gays, yet you dont hear them calling for WOW characters in wheelchairs do you.... 

People are saying Blizzard could do a better job. Nothing else. Some would call it feedback. You call it complaining. A matter of point of view. Not a definitive truth. 

And yes. Lets bring disabled people into it. You know what? I bet most disabled people are mature enough and kind enough people to know that their 
physical disabilities aren't exactly something that needs to be everywhere. 

On the other hand - and this might be new to you - nothing is wrong with you when you are gay. You are a perfectly normal human being whos natural sexuality makes you act out consenting sex with adults of the same sex. Yet people !@#$ing go around comparing gays to people with actual handicaps that should be taken serious, instead of degrading disabled people and gays by putting them in the same category, 
when the two groups clearly are different and have different needs.

Now that you mention it several games actually have handicapped people in them - even WoW. An entire clan of Orcs mutilate themselves ritually gouging out their own eye. I don't see people going all crazy and accusing handicapped people for causing "a disabled issue". One of the protagonists in GW2 is an Asura with a leg disease, so she made a Golem she can fight with. A fighting wheelchair. 

She is a loveable character, and no one complained. Because doing so would make you a %^-*ing douche. It is called inclusion. It is called acceptance and respect of diversity among people.

I have nothing against gay people, people can live their lives how they want to. What I have a problem with is people trying to make everything into a gay issue, wow should do this to include gays etc. No, wow is a game, there's no need to stuff it with gay people just to make some people feel better. 

WOW doesn't have any Christians, Muslims, Oriental, Asian people either, and the list goes on and on and on.....should they all be shoe-horned into the game just so its 'diverse' 

You know, I can sound like a real a-hole sometimes because I have heard so much bull when it comes the matter of talking about gay and lesbian sexuality. People make so many assumptions and treat their own little perspective as a definitive truth. 

As a gay man or lesbian woman you don't have that luxury. You need to justify your natural behaviour again and again, because you are a minority in that regard. The easiest and most abused argument in the history of man is: " 
The majority believes...". The majority isn't always right, and the majority are in fact not the only human beings on this planet. In fact you could count most gay and lesbian people amongst the majority because they share values and beliefs with people of other sexual orientations aswell. They are perfectly normal tax-paying citizens aswell. 

And that is the ENTIRE point. It is not just making something a "gay issue". It is a matter of belonging and being accepted within the communites and media we traverse in. 

Identification is the 
STRONGEST human emotion to make us relate to something, and when straight relationships are being poured all over the place the media we consume - even hyper sexualized as well - then it is perfectly normal for human beings to want to be included in that portrayal. Humans are social creatures. Being gay doesn't make you lose that craving. 

You say Christianity, Muslims, Orientals etc. are not in WoW. 

I think you need to read up on your WoW lore, because so many religions in WoW are heavily if not directly inspired from the world religions. Pandaren use heavy amounts of Buddhism and Confucianism. The Light is a DIRECT parody of Christianity. Stormwind has Cathedrals for gods sake. The Naaru and the Draenei bear resemblance to Islamic faith and even Wicca, Native American and Voodoo beliefs has made its way into WoW in the Tauren, Night Elf and Troll races. Druids were a religious historical celtic sect. 

Fiction borrows inspiration from the real life world. And WoW is NO different. No one can know everything about the world they borrow inspiration from, and in that part it is perfectly normal and okay, to let game developers know that they just can't pick out essential parts of certain cultures and the leave out essential parts or human beings of that culture. 

Look I am sure you are a nice guy, and I don't mean to demean you in any way. I just want you to understand that this isn't a "gay issue". It is a human issue that we all should take serious and treat with respect when brought up. Not just write is of as mere complaints.

It is a 12 rated game, And as a parent I certainly don't want my child playing with gay characters (NOTHING PERSONAL) In other words there is a time and place for everything, And WOW is not a place to promote your preferred sexuality, I am here to relax and socialise regardless of gender, race or sexuality. 

You think the community is vile now, What do you think would happen ? 

But there's plenty of explicity straight characters. Why are they okay to play with, but gay characters are not? I think this thread is unnecessary too but still... 

You say it's nothing personal, but you've clearly stated that you have issues with your child being around gay characters. In which case it 
is personal, and you're using your child as a shield for your own personal bais. Which is a pretty shameful display of parenting if you ask me. 

If you've got issues with gay people, just say you don't want them in the game, don't hide behind "protecting your child from teh gay". 12 years old isn't far off the age where children begin to discover their own sexuality, yet you're saying being gay is something to be hidden or subdued? How would that make your child feel if he/she was gay, do you think? 

If you're truely here to "to relax and socialise 
regardless of gender, race or sexuality." then you should be able to do that regardless of what orientation the characters are, eh? What of people who play, that are openly gay or straight or straight, would you prefer them forcibly silenced rather than little Timmy be exposed to something harmless you have personal problems with?

Final Fantasy VII - one of the most critical acclaimed fantasy RPG's had 
the main character crossdress to get information. He got the clothes 
from a gym full of muscular guys with strong gay innuendos.

The gay characters in Final Fantasy VII are mainly used as comic relief, 
and infact are pretty darn stereotypical, certainly -not- great 
representation of gay characters in video games.

27/11/2014 06:46Posted by eb94172be1229850

Persona - one of the best written gay characters is in this series. 
There isn't any sex. Only a character struggling to come to terms with 
his own sexuality.

If you're referring to Kanji, he's not actually gay. If you follow the 
information the game actually gives about him, he's either Straight or 
Bisexual. Regardless, he's really not written all that well, and is only 
given the acclaim he has because of the severe lack of gay representation 
anywhere else.Just had to pick you up about these two particular 
examples, many of your other ones though are solid. It's a refreshing 
change to see more and more games actually including LGBT characters, but 
there's still a -long- way to go, most of the time gay characters are 
still used as comic relief, stereotypes are still often used, and often 
developers go so far out of their way to not 'shove it in your face', that 
it's never even confirmed what their sexuality even is, making the 
inclusion of that character for representation purposes pointless.

-------------------

Yep. 

While I think it's fine to include in-game NPC characters that poke fun at stereotypes (of many different kinds), the fact that Blizzard has not, upto this moment at least, normalised gay sexuality in any serious way is one of the main positives that makes them stand out from other large gaming corporations (EA et al). 

Hopefully they believe doing so would risk alienating a large portion of their players and so best to stay out of this area altogether and not take sides.

-------------------

Let's talk about gay orc warriors and see how far tolerance really goes; last time i mentioned them I got several minus vote! 

Stereotyping is inevitable, but dangerous, it already goes too far - females are objectified as sexually hyped models, males are objectified as muscle hyped models. Sorry everyone but breasts do not make a woman and muscles do not make a goblin male! (e.g We see no oversexed between the legs male models) Likewise, if altersexuality were ever openly portrayed in game, (shock horror headline news female night elf in love with female undead!), it would probably be stereotyped dykes in leather and shaved heads... (Bald night elves?!) 
As for oversexualization of character models, the Drenaii are current champions, goblins, trolls and undead among the least guilty. Nevertheless, the assumption for most models is, Big Shoulders = male, boobs&smaller stature = female 

as for segregated realms, please no; let's not reinvent discrimination via the revolving door of PC.

-------------------

Why would they need to? 

Nobody freaking cares who you decide to sleep with now-a-days. Men, woman or both, just get on with the game.

-------------------

Gw2 did it, non blatant and not in your face kinda way. It was actualy a nice part of a story. 

if blizz doe go for a gay char, it needs to fit the story, or atleast the partnership between the 2 should support a story line.

-------------------

WOW doens't need any defends :D Blizzard have theri own lawyers to defend the Game :D

-------------------

Just to be clear I am not anti gay or anything. I have many a gay friend and I am proud to call them my friend. 

That being said, I play this game because it is a fantasy game set in a world not afflicted by Earth values or having to be politically correct at all points nor does it have to cater to all sexualities or genders. I make that separation very consciously much like I separate my work from my private life. They are not shared with each other. I do not feel that real life should always if at all be reflected in the games we play. 

This is important in the games we play, If a game came out where gay characters were just part of the world then no one would care. If a long running game suddenly added them then I would be concerned they were doing it for the wrong reasons. 

Even if it was done tastefully that would be by degrees and in some people's eye's only. To others it may not be tasteful at all and could have the completely opposite effect and cause more problems than it is worth.

Calm down everyone, I cracked the code, the other night, proving that one of the biggest heros in this world is transgender! 

I will help you crack the code aswell. 
Orc males, hunch backed without eyebrows. 
The females on the other hand stand with a straight back and have eyebrows, 
But! there is one orc male, unlike every other male orc, who stand straight, and has eyebrows. 
Meaning that this orc is Transgender. 

Yes boys and girls! The green Jesus, Thrall, is transgender, being the only orc male who stand up straight, and has eyebrows. 

Blizzard 1. 
people who think blizzard is not very accepting, 0.

-------------------

I would say that as much as I am for the inclusion of !@#$%^-*!@ characters even if only in a subtle way (as in, the same subtle way that #$%^-*!@#$%^ character relationships are mentioned), surely it would also depend on the lore concerning the various cultures within WoW. 

Tauren? Given the culture they are based on, it would not be unlikely to see a two-spirit individual, with a male or female wife depending on the bodied/spiritual gender of the Tauren in question. A druid would seem to fit the role of that more than a shaman, in my opinion at least. 

Orcs? Most fantasy settings tend to portray them as extremely misogynistic, with the females being trophies at best and chattel at worst. WoW tends to show them rather more equally - females fighting alongside the males being the best example. So that's an 'on the fencer'. 

Undead? Um... yeah, no. Certainly not physically anyway, but it would be oddly sweet if there was implied to be some manner of relationship after death between two characters, regardless of the sexuality presented. Certainly that would take it beyond the 'til death do us part' vow, yes? 

Blood Elf? As with what I was going to write with the night elves, blood elf society is what I would consider 'high'. They are not primitive by any means, and are magically advanced with flourishing cities. Therefore they would be one of the races that I would assume would be more open to the idea of -*!@#$%^-*ity being acceptable. 

Pandaren? Eastern culture in general has had !@#$%^-*!@ marriages in the past, often between older and younger women. Not so much between men however. Pandaren are also what I would consider more spiritually open and 'neutral', thus I cannot see them having an issue with it from what I have seen and read of how the culture is presented. 

Troll? See Orc. 

Goblin? I would probably say on the fence again. They seem to fall heavily on the technologically advanced side of things, but I have rarely seen any form of culture in the strictest sense as is shown with say, humans and blood elves. So, neutral. 

Onto the Alliance! 

Night Elves? See Blood Elves. They are what I think of as 'high' society, so, I would not think that there would be any strong reason for them to reject love between two members of the same sex. 

Human? Well we all know how human attitudes defer regarding this subject, don't we? ;) So naturally, I would imagine that such an attitude would carry over into the human culture as presented in WoW. Some would hate it with a passion, some would hide it, some would be proud of it all depending on their geographical location, closest cultural influences and so forth. 

Gnomes? See Goblins. 

Dwarves? Given the heavily Norse cultural references, I would assume therefore that Dwarven culture reflects the fact that at least male #$%^-*!@#$ity would make the male 'weak'. But then again, Earth Norse culture also implies that that magic users are weak, so. But there is little to no mention of them frowning so heavily on female %^-*!@#$%^ity. 

Draenei? They are literally alien, so to expect them to have anything close to the human perspective of sexuality and romantic relationships is laughable. 

Worgen? They were once human, so, going with what I wrote for the humans here. 

This is all, of course, just my personal ramblings on the subject based on how I perceive the cultures in-game :)

satisfying a childish whim.I don't want an ingame representation of an 
epic character with a red shirt because I like them more than blue or 
white shirts. You know why? Because it's f*cking common sense.

Fantasy use elements of reality as its building blocks, if it were not so, how would we ever build magic

Sure blizzard could add a gay character, but it would have to actually mean something, influence the character, change them. 
I don't think you could do that in a 12+ game. 

I´m sorry but I fail to see the connection between those two sentences. What´s wrong with underaged people seeing gay characters? 

There is nothing wrong with that, but it's the sexuality part. For example, have sex ever benefited anyone in this game? Is there any stories where someone used sex to manipulate someone else. No? Then how would you write a story where gay is important to the character. 
Are you going to have other, homophobic characters, that are against this gay character? Are you going to just team two guys together and have them tag team across azeroth? Because then what makes those more than just "buddies" - Why is it important that one or both of them is gay? 

Talking about sexuality at all in World of Warcraft just isn't plausible. Straight, gay, bi or whatever. If you don't talk about any of them, there really is no "discrimination" or "exclusion"

Blizzard would be forced to shut down the game in Russia. It's illegal to spread "gay propaganda" to minors there. 

Not that I think they'd have much joy over it in the good old USA either. Hacking people into small pieces is nice, setting the pieces on fire is OK, but any mention of sex or actual nipples? BURN THE WITCH!

Hopefully they believe doing so would risk alienating a large portion of their players and so best to stay out of this area altogether and not take sides. 

Ironically, by acknowledging that there are "sides" in this matter you are taking sides already. You acknowledge there are conservatives and religious people playing your game, so it´s better to stay out of trouble by not adding what they hate, therefore you are on their side. 
Not taking sides would mean not caring if a male character had a husband or not. "Hey, let´s write a quest for this character, he lost his life´s couple and wants revenge for it", "So was that couple male or female?", "Whatever suits you". 
Instead I can imagine: "Hey, let´s write a quest for this character, he lost his life´s couple and wants revenge for it", "So was that couple male or female?", "Are you nuts? Do you realize how many russians play this game?", "Oh, that´s true". 

A valid business decission, but don´t say they are not taking sides.

-------------------

Keep sexuality, religion and anything that mirrors real life current or high profile historical political events out the game altogether. Games are not the place to discuss these issues or to try tackle them. They should be tackled seriously in the proper places, such as school and at home.

Sorry to quote you specifically when lots of people have said this, your 
post was the more handy.Sorry to say but Warcraft already has tons and 
tons of influence from the real life, like the pandaren culture, Garrosh´s 
actions mirroring those of a certain german, thousands of pop culture 
references (some even part of the official lore), alien races acting 
according to Earth values, Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor vaguely 
resembling Earth, the tauren culture, etc.That aside, adding a gay 
character doesn´t automatically mean: "Oh my gosh! They are making out in 
public! Now the age limit will have to be raised to 18+!". A questgiver 
could tell you to find or avenge his husband and that would be all. Why 
not add a gay couple as long as they behave just like any other couple 
already in game? It´s the same thing!

high profile historical political events out the game altogether.

the trouble is....they are already in the game....there ARE hetr0sexual 
relationships in there.so yes, exclusion DOES apply.Why is it ok 
to have hetr0 relationships, but not gay ones....STILL no one has answered 
this, and ive asked it three times.....if you can have one, why not the 
other?(and one DOES exist.)religion isnt comparable....the 
religions we have in game are purposefully "different" to real world 
religions specifically because of this kind of issue.YES we can draw 
parallels between an in game religion, and its obvious inspiration in the 
real world....but they are not specifically real world religions.....so 
that argument is not even relevant, or comparable.sexuality IS in 
game.....ther ARE straight, married couples in game....couples having 
children in obvious implicit hetr0 relationships.....so why is it taboo to 
have the gay counterpart.....any reason can only be discriminatory."oh 
because....russians" - well, the chinese didnt like bones 
showing on undeads....so guess what? they have a different 
client....surely something similar could be done for the russians 
(although in my opinion thats just pandering to bigotry)"oh 
because.....conservative americans" - see my point above."there 
are already gay npcs" - again, covered this.....its 
innuendo....its suggestion, there are no IMPLICIT same sex partnerships or 
questlines in wow."how does the story/lore handles gays" 
- doesnt HAVE to be a major plot line, it just needs to be there.....like 
ive already said - quest in stormwind where a lady asks you to take her 
sons sewing kit to his fathers shop for him.....why couldnt that have been 
a male questgiver? - does that hugely change the story? nope....neither 
did the original. daphne and jordan stillwell.....could easily have been 
derek and jordan stilwell....and finally -"wont someone 
think of the children?!" - bigotry however you slice 
it....its saying that young people shouldnt be exposed to gay people....there 
hasnt been a single valid or good reason why the inclusion of 
gay(bi/ts/etc) npcs, or questlines cannot be included in the game....its 
not about showboating and fighting the cause for gaykind......its simply 
about equal inclusive representation....nothing special, just being there.

-------------------

it's a very touchy subject that can have very serious effects on your business, you just don't do it when targeting a world wide audience. It's as simple as that.

valid or good reason

perhaps you missed that bit - i quoted myself for you just in case.gay 
marriage is not only accepted in most of europe, but actually legal in 
many of its parts.the odd few places where its not only frowned upon, 
but outright illegal to "spread" the c"urse of gay-ism"....can be dealt 
with as i stated with a different client, just like the chinese 
were....personally i wouldnt pander to that bigotry, but im a realist and 
know you cant change the world in one go, so theres youre 
answer....different clients....same game, just differing npcs for the 
countries evolved and enlightened enough to handle it.

Can't recall blizzard stating somewhere the characters are straight. Can 
someone?

daphne stillwell quest chain sends you eventually to find her 
husband....its implicit in the questline that they are married and in a 
hetr0 relationship....players can make anything else out of it they wish 
to (secretly bisexual etc) but state din black and white - 
married....husband and wife.sunwalker dezco - his WIFE dies, he saves 
his children and goes on to fight for peace in pandaria in her 
memory....IMPLICITLY hetr0sexualmakrik - find my wifemankrik 
markII - find my girlfriend - both implicitly hetr0sexual.there 
are many many more instances of implicit hetr0sexual relationships in the 
game.....

-------------------

Valid reason. 

IT CAN HAVE A BAD EFFECT ON BUSINESS. 

I put it in caps incase you missed it the first time around. You mightn't like it but that's the world we live in one day it will change but today is not that day. Until it's 100% risk free then it's not going to happen. Simple as that.

"oh because....russians" - well, the chinese didnt like bones showing on 
undeads....so guess what? they have a different client....surely 
something similar could be done for the russians (although in my opinion 
thats just pandering to bigotry)

Simple as that.

which bit of "different client" did you ignore?showing 
bones on the undead was deemed "bad for business" in china, something to 
do with how they honour their dead, it was deemed inappropriate.....so 
instead of blanket coverage removing all undead bones, a seperate client 
was created where the undead showed no bones, specifically for the chinese 
market........please dont take this as a personal attack....ive 
ignored the blatant bigotry in your post simply because i dont think you 
are actually like that.....but i really want to highlight it to you all 
the same......in america up until very very recently, black people 
were segregated into their own areas....white people who owned businesses 
wouldnt allow the to integrate, because - you know, it was bad for 
business.the rode the buses up front, because you know - it was bad 
for business to allow them to mingle (in case white people caught the 
black)its even MORE recently that south africa changed their policies 
regarding black people and abolished apartheid....but up until that point, 
blacks were treat the same, because - you guessed it! was bad for business.simply 
stating that "its bad for business" infers that being gay is a negative 
thing...that allowing gay people to mingle with "normal straight people" 
is bad, and will make sales drop......THATS the bigotry im talking 
about....like i say, dont take it personal, i dont think you are a bigot, 
or hom0phobic.....i just want you to consider the thought process behind 
what youve said, and why you said it, and understand the underlying 
feelings and where you came by them.

Do you think of it as an insult? 

If so, who brainwashed you into thinking it's OK to try to demean people who care about other people? 

Doesn't it strike you as a bit weird, when you stop and think about it?

Said it once and i'll say it again. 

Nothing in coding is "a couple of hours work". 

A change in one line affects lines in the code not even related to that, thus why so many bugs appear in large scale games. 

Coding an entirely new client is a massive undertaking, it would need to yield massive profit for any company to be willing to do it. 

You can argue until your blue in the face but it's all about the money and the money they would make for doing what you propose wouldn't be worth their time. 

They don't do it to be "bigoted", they do what they do for profit. That's how business works and gaming is massive business. If something isn't profitable then it isn't done. 

They can't cater to every single demographic, that's just not how the world works

Theres a difference in caring for the sick an elderly 

Waving a huge signpost in people faces with "I CARE ABOUT GAY RIGHTS" in huge pink caps on it and then trying to shoehorn it into a neutral game is not caring its just a attempt to be edgy 

Like i said, i dont judge peoples sexuality but trying to cross real world issues into games just for the sake of it, really really isnt the right thing to do 

Its a international game, and as soon as you introduce a subject like for instance "gays" etc will only cause those from the other side of the camp, the haters, the bigots to come out and ebfore you know it countries are boycotting

You're totally wrong. We're not putting it in the game so children can learn about it. People are gay, they don't learn to be gay. The reason people want to see gay people represented in WOW is because they believe that minorities should be represented in all communities. Which is why you can make characters with different colour skin and why the last expansion had an Asian theme. 

But generally, there is no need to have it represented in general, I think it's been pointed out many times that just because there are no overtly gay/camp characters in the game, does not mean there are no gay people. There are probably many, it's just we don't get to see any characters in the bedroom right?

-------------------

You tell my one news paper that wouldn't love 

WORLD OF BIGOTRYCRAFT: BLIZZARD COMPLYS WITH RUSSIAS ANTI HOMOSEUALITY LAWS

As a headline there is no escaping the backlash of putting gay characters in the game then removing them to please a bigoted country. You are going to get burnt if you pulled a stunt like that.

Not to mention giving the "videogame are bad hmmmkay" crowd more ammo "omg video games made my son gay"

Coding an entirely new client is a massive undertaking, 

i agree....which is why it would only need a few npcs to be reskinned, which ISNT a totally new client. 
reskinning is a fairly easy job, the skeleton is already there, and the skinning process is a matter of changing layers....not recoding the whole thing. 

thast the only major differences in the two *proposed* clients i mentioned.....i would never expect them to fully recode an entire client. 

text in a quest and reskinning are very very easy and simple jobs, they dont affect the client in huge ways, and ARE a matter of a few hours work...... 
they have limited impact on the game engine as they do not have associated mechanics....the skeletons of the quest givers etc are already there, just wearing different guises.

Seriously, why should all minorities be represented in 
everything? 

It's just a ridiculous request, if there is no specific reason for a minority to be included then they don't need to be. Developers can add them if they feel like it, if they'd rather spend their time on something else then they can. If you don't like it, don't play the game. Or get over it.

But when little kids are playing a GAME , then we will have to be a little more restrict to matters like this for sake of our younger co-players.

in which case we need to remove all hetr0sexual npcs and quests in case my gay daughter catches a dose of the straight........fair? 

See, like i said, its not like its some horrible disease its natural and normal 

So far the only ones throwing silly fits are you

Fantasy and art is also a product of imagination, which is by definition not bound by societal rules. I understand your policy, and I commend your passionate ambassadorship for a community to which I too belong, but the bottom line is that it is the discretion of the writer. 

Wow is not mandatory, and it is not prescribe. It also makes no statement on sexuality, or sexual preference. The bigotry card is therefore a non-sequitur. 

The moment we try to force Blizzard (or any artist for that matter) to include whatever minority merely for the sake of representation, we are not only robbing that inclusion of the beauty of spontaneity, but also infringing the right of the artist.

Blizzard always keep every situation as nautral as possible, relgions sexuality etc 

However they want a world to seems alive, which means children and children are born to parents 

They arent secretly hiding gays or !@#$%^-*!@ity in any way 

Your making a issue out of nothing, in a similar vein furries could be in here next, or the BDSM scene, or any other minority you can think of 

klu klux klan members wanting hoods as a choice? 

Theres a middle ground, and thats keeping all such issues out of a game enjoyed by a diverse and varied bunch 

Blizzard has chose that route, be happy for it

The blood elf males seem very effeminate to me.

Blizzard always keep every situation as nautral as possible, relgions sexuality etc 

Now you reminded me of an incident that happend 8 years ago on Nordrassil Server. 

There was 2 guys , Human Rogues , same dress same outfit (level 1) Bolds (i mean without hair , sorry for my bad English) that was walking on SW and was saying (not yelling) Oi Skinheads , etc etc etc. 

What blizzard did ?? 
Gave them a nice ban i suppose i don't know actually but those 2 never appeared again in SW or anywhere again. 

Neutral is the better option for MMORPG Games , as you all saw television programs like Watchdog as waiting in the corner with a minigun and a movable target to hit anything that moves .

You're totally wrong. We're not putting it in the game so children can learn about it. People are gay, they don't learn to be gay. The reason people want to see gay people represented in WOW is because they believe that minorities should be represented in all communities. 

Seriously, why should all minorities be represented in 
everything? 

It's just a ridiculous request, if there is no specific reason for a minority to be included then they don't need to be. Developers can add them if they feel like it, if they'd rather spend their time on something else then they can. If you don't like it, don't play the game. Or get over it. 

I never said they should, I said that's the reason anyone's even talking about this. I never said that in my opinion every minority should be represented. Wow is hardly where I come to learn about !@#$ing morals.

But for a lot of people, !@#$%^-*!@ity is 
not a normal part of life. 

I can't think of a single h0m0sexual person (that I know) that I interact with on a weekly or even monthly basis. 

When I see a h0m0sexual couple kissing in public I take notice precisely because it isn't usual. 

Having a h0m0sexual couple in game would stand out for a lot of people, so it doesn't matter if you think it is 'normal/usual' or w/e, for most it stands out and looks like Blizzard making a firm stand on the issue

But we arent ignorant? we are looking at the bigger picture, being gay doesnt make you special or unique, its totally and completly normal in a civilised society, unfortunatly not all the countried served by blzzard are this way 

And with immigration as it is, they cant NOT include it for some countries because if for instance a russian plays from the uk and see this, will he/she be offended?

And what exactly does a gay char look and behave like? And what character is known all over azeroth for their luck with the opposite gender? There is LGBT RP guilds that are out there. I just dont see where sexuality comes in WoW lore. Nobody said about RP though.

Talking about sexuality at all in World of Warcraft just isn't plausible. Straight, gay, bi or whatever. If you don't talk about any of them, there really is no "discrimination" or "exclusion" 

the trouble is....they are already in the game....there ARE hetr0sexual relationships in there. 
so yes, exclusion DOES apply. 
Why is it ok to have hetr0 relationships, but not gay ones....STILL no one has answered this, and ive asked it three times.....if you can have one, why not the other? 
(and one DOES exist.) 

Alright so you have this gay couple in world of warcraft. Then what? They get married. Okay. What is the point of that? How will it benefit who? 

What's the difference between two dudes being bro's and fist bumping after a successful mission and these two gay guys who just got married? What's the point? It's just fan-service. 
How would you find something that makes being gay an important part of the scenario while keeping it pegi 12?

YOU are contributing to separation if you want every character to flash their sexuality for there mere purpose of satisfying a childish whim. 

When did I say I wanted them to 'flash their sexuality'? Why is it people don't seem to realise that you -can- confirm a character's sexuality without doing it in a showy, needlessly-intrusive way? 

There are -plenty- of examples of straight characters in video games. They don't just randomly say "Oh hey by the way I'm straight wooo!" do they? You just learn it from the simple fact that they happen to have a partner of the opposite sex, or from them having a crush or feelings toward someone of the opposite sex, and no-one ever bats an eyelid at this. However, someone asking to have a character who just happens to have a partner of the -same- sex, or to show any sort of romantic feelings towards someone of the -same- sex, is apparently terrible because then it's 'flashing your sexuality'. 

This mindset, of having a double-standard where it's perfectly fine to have openly straight characters, to the extent that some people even seem to claim there -aren't- 'openly-straight characters' in games, and where asking for gay characters in exactly the same kind of situations, is apparently wrong and terrible, is quite simply homophobic.

/thread. 

When you start arguing that the mere mention of sexuality is like "flashing it", then you are automaticly enforcing cenorship upon a game that already delve into subjects of relationships and love. I've mentioned several cases of character development in WoW where personal love life and relationship is key to a character. You do set a double-standard by doing this, and you pander 
to people who demand that their personal views on LGBT peoples private lives are being treated as the norm in general society. Which in essence is what h0m0phobia is.

The gaming community by and large just reflects what white, heter0 males want it to. That isn't in my mind due to some Machiavellian conspiracy, but rather because the gaming industry is not representative of players or society. It's right wing and oppressive. If something isn't a problem for an individual, they make no effort to see how it could be for someone else. In fact, they tend to go a step further and attempt to denigrate both you as an individual, and your argument because it holds no interest to them. 

Entirely back the OP, but you won't find the support you are looking for amongst this community. Depresses me that you've been downvoted so heavily, but it was predictable.

I'll probably get shot down for this - but I was wondering why WoW has no gay characters? Gays play the game too, and it's the 21st Century and all. 

A lot of young people play the game, and it'd make a good impression, and help people be more accepting in everyday life. 

Yes, I'm gay, and don't really care about the homophobes, but think WoW would be doing themselves a service if they implemented a character into the game which is gay. 

So you are implying that you being gay makes you different from us being straight???

Well it clearly does. Much as being a man is different to being a woman, being Black is different to being White and being upstairs is different to being downstairs. 

The only question open to interpretation is what the implications of these differences are, not whether they are indeed different things.

To that point there are none it makes no difference to socity what your sexual preference is. The only time it would be a problem to socity is if over 70% of the population was !@#$%^-*!@ because it would hinder growth.

-------------------

There are few overtly !@#$%^ characters in the entire lore and most of those "couples" tend to be part of a romance that does not end well. 

so most npc's could be either, or both and blizzard has therefore done a great job of avoiding stereotyping. 

the OP seems to want promotional portrayal of a gay lifestyle. Anyone interested in such would be able to find out all about it by now, surely, at least in the west ? blizz would need to make some judgment calls if they went down that road and would come in for all sorts off critcism. 

the world as a whole has a much more fundamental issue to get past, gender stereotyping and the fact that in many parts of the world, being born female is a huge stroke of bad luck.

-------------------

Given WoW's PEGI 12 rating... Well, I don't think that sexuality is something that's even on Blizzards radar. At least not to the point that they'd concern themselves with specifically depicting a character as either straight or gay. There are some that have kids, are/get married, but that's it. Sexuality as a whole isn't much of a topic in WoW. 

Also, how would you have them depict it? Having some super queer character would only end up as a (insensitive) joke anyway, and I'd say that the differences are too subtle to convey otherwise.

I think the bolded bit is a classic trap people fall into when attempting not to stereotype. Avoiding stereotyping someone and essentially making a trait they have irrelevant are two different things. For example, a well written gay character needs to avoid being a stereotype 
without ignoring the fact they are gay, or what would be the point? That can be achieved by them being in a same sex relationship, but equally can be accomplished through storyline or character traits that are the result of being gay. A character who has been oppressed due to their sexuality or found adversity in some situation due to not conforming to societal expectations.

Given WoW's PEGI 12 rating... Well, I don't think that sexuality is something that's even on Blizzards radar. At least not to the point that they'd concern themselves with specifically depicting a character as either straight or gay. There are some that have kids, are/get married, but that's it. Sexuality as a whole isn't much of a topic in WoW. 

And I think this would be the problem that the OP sees, why is a "straight" relationship completely normal and appropriate for a PEGI 12 rating and a gay one not? Having two human male protagonists in a relationship shouldn't be any more of an issue than any of the other relationships in game.

The relationships ingame are mostly implied by someone having kids. Gay relationships = no kids. Might be that there are some, but they're not obvious enough for players to even notice. 

The only reason I'm mentioning the PEGI rating is because you don't see characters humping each other - or even kissing or whatever, probably due to that rating. As such, you can't really tell who's gay and who's straight - the NPCs don't seem to act on their sexuality, either way.

-------------------

I'd love to see better representation for gay people within the medium of games. In a game like WoW, with thousands of minor and major characters, it wouldn't take much to have a small number of gay or bisexual characters involved in a quest or storyline. 

There have been a number of small hints with certain characters lately, specifically with Wrathion/Anduin in the legendary questline and in War Crimes. I particularly like the WC quote: 

“When I’m a little older," Wrathion announced, "I shall, if asked politely, take you on my back and ferry you to fascinating places, where we will have adventures that will age your father ten years in one night.” 

It'd be great if Blizzard would pull the trigger and make Wrathion's affection for Anduin more clearly romantic as it would add another layer to the character and further storyline potential.

-------------------

I thought those 2 death knights were openly gay? Koltira and whoever

-------------------

to all saying that "this game doesn't need sexuality" .... haven't jaina and arthas expressed their sexuality upon falling in love for each other? 

there's even a whole expansion + dungeon during which jaina chases after him. 

but that's ok for the "12yo kids" to see? only because it's a straight romance? so you assume that a gay romance is something that doesn't fit 12yo kids, as if it were something weird, unnatural or unappropriate.

This is just completely untrue. There are a myriad of characters who have relationships developed in the Warcraft universe that are not dependant on Children. The already mentioned Arthas and Jaina, then off the top of my head Tyrande and Malfurion don't either. 

Out of interest, why do people feel the need to try and justify it not existing? A same sex relationship is no more "adult" than one between a man and a woman. If anything them having children makes the relationship inherently more sexual.

This thread in a nutshell 
"Yay, gays" 
"Hell no, gays!" 
"The children!" 
"The immersion!" 
"Male BElves!" 
"All good male friends are obviously gay for eachother." 

That said, as a !@#$, I wouldn't really mind some escort quest where a man says husband instead of wife.

It's revolves around two male Orc hunters.

How can a post with +14 be considered as highly rated,while another with +19 isn't?Now that's discrimination. 

But as mentioned in the earlier posts,there's no need for sexuality in the game.If anything it might look discriminating somehow. 

Yet making such characters noticable could be good for the storyline.I'm extremelly neutral about this topic.

For example there are wild animals which born gay, but they are eaten 
and killed early by stronger and more agressive male specimens

Actually this is not necessarily true. There's been a lot of research on 
same gender attraction (and action) among animals and it turned out it is 
actually not that uncommon that males of certain species will be attracted 
to other males, and females to females. And they won't even bite each 
others' heads off. I guess humans liking the same gender is pretty natural 
:).So besides your post being very narrowminded, it's blatantly 
untrue.

-------------------

I would like some gay characters as long as they're not stereotypical, and it's not made into an issue, but I just cheer myself up by seeing all the elves and draeni as gay anyway. If my tauren shamen was that way inclined, I'd definitely go out with her, because she has a sexy dance I can watch for aaages...

-------------------

Just because gay characters do not yell at the world their sexuality like gay peoples do it in real life, doesn't mean there are none in the game. Not everyone is obsessed by sexual preferences, especially in a game.

-------------------

like we said for the millionth time, 

every single straight person living his/her relationship openly (like jaina and arthas) "yells his/her sexuality at the world" (because doing so gives hint of his/her sexual orientatoin) 

so the reason why gay characters shouldn't do the same is beyond me.

So much this. But the forums aren't interested.

-------------------

If it hasn't already been mentioned, the latest Steamy Romance Novel: Savage Passions, focuses on male/male 'smut', with our hero Marcus and Raven, the stablehand you actually get in your alliance Stables building in your garrison.

-------------------

yes it was mentioned and i am sure it's a step towards the right direction. i think the company takes in great consideration every gender and preference.

-------------------

every single straight person living his/her relationship openly "yells his/her sexuality at the world" 

On the other hand, it's the duty of the high and mighty to eventually marry for political power and a heir or two. And the duty of ordinary people to produce children to take care of the family and serve their lord. Duty, not necessarily pleasure. A fair few are probably doing what they really prefer in secret with someone else than their spouse.

-------------------

1. Blizzard aint Bioware, they make mmos and rts:es, not compelling stories with well crafted characters. 
2. If wow would be a rpg then it wouldn't be any problem since they are a bit niche, whereas wow is kind of a staple of games. That means they are under more scrutiny than, say, dragon age inquisition that has a well made gay character. If blizzard were to put a gay in their game, it could spark an outrage amongst conservatives, which would cause public uproar. That would lead to lots of bad press and a news article in fox new how wow is corrupting the youth. And they don't want that. 
All in all, blizzard has neither the balls nor the ability to add openly gay characters to this game afaik.

She's not really confirmed to be gay, it's implied, but that's not really what people are necessarily asking for. People want characters who are openly gay in the sense that we as players know they're definitely gay. Vague implications don't really count as representation.

I'll probably get shot down for this - but I was wondering why WoW has no gay characters? Gays play the game too, and it's the 21st Century and all. 

A lot of young people play the game, and it'd make a good impression, and help people be more accepting in everyday life. 

Yes, I'm gay, and don't really care about the homophobes, but think WoW would be doing themselves a service if they implemented a character into the game which is gay. 

Erm... every time I click on a human male from any location other than Gilneas (other than worker, peasant from Garrison) I get a camp response: 

"Why hello their" I assumed that was a reference... 

Then we have Anduin Wrynn... clearly he has to be a fairy! 

Garrosh Hellscream is clearly a bear.... 

Big Bearded, Muscular dwarves when clicked on say in a gruff voice "Can I interest you in a pint?" Clearly Grizzly Adams Bears 

Arthus who turned down Jaina Proudmore... clearly... he has to be...Jaina F&*(^$g Proudmore! 

The Goblins with the high pitched voices "HURRY BACK" 

The male Gnomes who excitedly say "MY your a tall one!" 

Khadagar The Mage who gives you the epic & legendary ring is clearly hiding something colorful! 

Also do not forget BENJAMIN BODE:

How would they achieve this? An NPC telling everyone who clicks on him/her that their gay? Havng an NPC standing next to them of the same gender? I don't see many "single" NPC (as in represented in-game as not with a partner) expressing a sexual preference whether that is straight or gay. We, as players, can do that for them if we so wish. This is an RPG after all. 

IMO this is an "issue" that does not need addressing.

-------------------

I seriously hope everyone reporting the op gets a warning for the abusing the report function.The op has a valid point. 

There are so many homophobes playing wow(and in this thread) it is clearly a issue and everything that potentially can help normalising it is a step in the good direction.Like it or not Blizzard is a leading company and their stance still has some value.But they need to be more open about their stance,not only state it when someone applies for a job but also state it by means of lore.Start in a book then implement in game.Easy and it hurts noone.

-------------------

Well, I have done few funny quests that have a hint on that. Like <the day Deathwing came> one. When you do the third one, there are some females and one male blood elf that are admiring the orc and want him to take them for a romantic ride. You can choose the male blood elf.

Which isn´t fair for themselves or their spouses, since nowadays you can have children despite your sexuality. You don´t need to fool yourself or your partner in order to do so. Sure, it might be more difficult, but it is completely possible. 

I understand where this kind of people come from, and it is extremely ironic that they are the ones that support that kind of laws and behavior in the first place, since they are throwing stones at their own roof, but I don´t think living a lie is a healthy life.

-------------------

Why stop at gays, why not one of every possible combination of minority groups? 

I dont see any characters of mixed african-chinese heritage, or any transgender Romanian women or any eunuch Polar bear characters. 

Its a total non-issue. 

I really wish minority groups would stop all this "dont treat me differently because of my lifestyle choice, however you HAVE to treat us differently (i.e. better) because of my lifestyle choice. 

And, for the record , the estimated gay population is around 4% (for theUSA, and depending on your source) 

That would like equate to about 4 main characters being of the LGBT persuasion. Which is already represented in-game. Read some of the other posts for obvious and non-obvious examples.

As someone who has bought mounts/pets from the store, this has gone too far imo. 

This mount looks far better (in terms of colours, graphics, uniqueness) than many if not all of the raiding mounts available. 

Shouldn't have been wasted on the store.

-------------------

Pretty much the same with the Celestial Charger. A beautiful mount aswell, though I wont pay 20 euros for it.

-------------------

lol..i bought it and i love it. But face the facts...they will continue to do this eitherway, i love the game and ill still buy things if i can afford it..its nothing more like buying my make up or candy. 

its priorities.

-------------------

It's in the UK store too (& the Celestial Charger is only 10 euros)

-------------------

Ok, I bought it straight away and I love it. But this is by far the coolest model in game, I liked celestial steed but I wasnt too hurt by it being in blizz store... but this is lame. We've seen the effects of selling blizz store mounts and imo the coolest mount in game is about to become a massive joke. First time i've ever said this but seriously, gg blizz, I really wish this wasn't available to absolutely everyone 

Edit: I'd just like to say that I wouldn't be as hurt by this if some of the newer models that require a little bit of dedication and work for like the new lovebird and stuff like darkmoon mounts actually looked cool. But the fact that those suck (imo) and something that looks as if it has had a tonne of work put into it and only requires what took a frantic orc 30 secs to buy off blizz store is in a way killing an aspect of the game I am fond of (farming mounts). Can't blizz start putting crap like the swift lovebird and recoloured models in the blizz store instead?

-------------------

Maybe I'll win it from mmo champion? Yeah... right...

-------------------

This is just the start, the s**t will hit the proverbial fan tomorrow when everyone and their uncle has it, all these bright, shiney dragons flying around Org/SW are gonna be enough to give someone a epileptic fit... 

And it's such a shame to see such an awesome mount/model wasted in this way.

-------------------

Of course it ended up in the store... It's disgusting how they charge so much for a in-game item. 

it will lose its appeal after 2 weeks and then you'll regret buying it

Would be so much better if only a few had it, so that when you did see it you'd be like "aaah :D" not "grrr!"

-------------------

Its a disgrace. And I have been defending Blizzard so much and I get this. Wasted my time.

-------------------

!@#$ like this makes me want to quit wow.. 

At least make stuff like these tradeable so that I can buy it off the AH and be just as cool as everyone else, until I get bored and mount my white gryphon again.

-------------------

Such an awesome looking mount, really disappointed that they used it as a Store mount, it had so much potential just to be wasted in such a manner, I wonder why so much effort is put into this model, when the Dragon Soul mounts are so basic and aren't much more complex than the Bronze Drake. 

Oh well, business is business...

-------------------

what differense does it make if its common or not? I thought the ulduar glory 25 was bloody awesome and now every1 and their grandmas have it. Same with icc mounts. You dont need a slight clue what to do,just be there and voila, free achieves and mounts. 

stop the special snowflake shiz already. 

And oh yeah i get where you are coming from, but if they gave us this as a taste of what is coming we can just wait to see what they will have in MoP.

-------------------

All the core members in one guild on my realm has just bought it. So they've filled Orgrimmar now! :P 

As of this minute, literally half of everyone in Orgrimmar is on this mount.

-------------------

Bet in MoP every mount ingame will be avaible at the store.

-------------------

In my opinion, adding it to the blizzard store has been one of the worst decisions they've made for this expansion. It's arguably one of the nicest and shiniest looking drakes / mounts in the game currently. It's related to current content. It could have been added as something gained after completing x achievement or x heroic raid encounter. Nope. Added lazily to the blizzard store so that everyone can dump £17 on it. I really don't want to be "That guy" but I can't see any real reason why they would put this up on the Blizzard Store other than for profit. 

When bad players get the nicest looking reward for no effort required, that's when I flip tables. I don't wish to sound elitist, but something that nice and "obvious" should not be put up so that everyone can get it.

Coming from a veteran mount collector, this is disappointing. This would'ave made a lovely 150 mount achievement! (Matches the Chinese/celestial dragon pet for the 150 Companion achievement.)

My two copper on this matter: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAKwG4VqUgk

-------------------

As the others have already said, I too hoped it would become the 150 Mount Achievement reward, given just how amazing the mount looks. 

Sure, as a store mount it will get used by far more people than mount collectors or raiders, but reducing it to the Celestial Horse fad is unnecessary. It would have been a far more fitting "Glory of the Pandaria Raider" reward or something; exclusive in the beginning, but also approachable by anyone who wants to get a run going after the content is no longer relevant (the same way people still run Ulduar and ICC for the drakes and the same way people will surely raid Firelands for the Firehawk). 

Might as well go for the real cash grab and make the old ZG mounts also purchasable from the store.

-------------------

Sigh. 

I would have LOVED this as something to work towards, though Meta achievements in DS or something - It's stunning, and not the usual Drake Reskin crap. 

And it's in the store only. 

I normally don't give two cents about what Blizzard put in their store - Cosmetic stuff is vanity and usually it's fine, but this is a drake that fits in with the current scene, it would fit perfect in the new raid - but instead it's another cash cow. 

Thanks Blizzard.

-------------------

they working on paypal , you can see this on your account page, 
I wait..till its work. 
then I buy the new mount

And please don't give us a spectral anything for 150 mounts. They're not as nice ... or substantial.

You people are so selfish, the problem is not that everyone will have it, the problem is that some people wont have it. Kids that , lets face it probably want it the most , because they simple do not have the money for it and that is the only and pretty big issue I have with blizzard store.

Such an incredible waste!! A special looking mount like this should be reserved for a feature of certain achievement, at least for a while. 
So much of the content in this expansion has been recycled, so many bugs gone unfixed, yet they do have time and resources for this? 
Sure it makes sense from a $ point of view, but we're paying for expansion packs, and a subscription on top of that, what are we supposed to think of this? 
It's making me feel unappreciated as a loyal costumer and sooner or later that's going to take it's cost!

The anger is that it's one of the rare good looking mounts for a while, it fits with the current theme, and it would have been perfect as a reward for either PvE Metas or Collectors for 150 Mounts. 

Instead, it went in the store. The lazy and cash cow way.

And please don't give us a spectral anything for 150 mounts. They're not 
as nice ... or substantial.

Wut? :PSpectral mounts are the nicest mounts!But then again, I am 
a "Uuuh! Shiny!" type of person :)

-------------------

When bad players get the nicest looking reward for no effort required, 
that's when I flip tables. I don't wish to sound elitist, but 
something that nice and "obvious" should not be put up so that 
everyone can get it.

Get over yourself.

For what? Wanting something which looks 
decent to have some objective to it? That I don't like the fact that they 
add something like this lazily to the blizzard store when it could have 
been implemented as something to work for in game? Instead of showing no 
contribution to the thread over than to make yourself look like a fool, 
please have a little constructive feedback like I and all the others have 
done instead of just 3 words. I'm in no mood to bicker with people like 
you publicly so you have a problem with me, by all means log onto 
Quel'thalas. I'm on 9807b2d01a81b14f right now and we can discuss things 
further there.

-------------------

Quoting this from US forums since it's spot on. 

First unique mount model in ages... 

And it's a !@#$%^- store mount. 

I can't even BEGIN to express my disappointment at this.

-------------------

Sweet... can't wait to see SW flooded with these...

-------------------

In the past I have bought several of the Blizz store pets, especially ones that also donated some of my purchase to charity. Mounts I always refused to buy. 

Seeing this mount in the store... This beautiful mount, with lovely colors, animations...and compare it to meta achievement mounts ingame...what a waste. Really Blizz, you crossed the line. The theme would have been perfect for something in the DS raid, or just something in the 4.3 patch. Maybe some grand epic storyline filled with lore. But no, you award people with bland recolors and put one of the most detailed looking mounts ever in the store. 

I am all for accessable mounts for raiders and non-raiders alike, but this is too much.

-------------------

As many of you have said, this is the nicest looking mounts in the game. Now put your business hats on, apply your brain, think about how much money this will make blizz, and what a good idea it is from their perspective. 

Finally, the great thing is you all have the choice whether or not to buy it, and most of you will haha! 

After getting over the intial upset this is pretty logical I guess. This is seriously gonna rake in the cash cause I bet most of the people complaining here (me included) bought one of these as well as they people that we don't want to have them :P

You people are so selfish, the problem is not that everyone will have it, the problem is that some people wont have it. 

Lol where did this knee jerk "u r kids" reaction come from? 

The anger is that it's one of the rare good looking mounts for a while, it fits with the current theme, and it would have been perfect as a reward for either PvE Metas or Collectors for 150 Mounts. 

Instead, it went in the store. The lazy and cash cow way. 

So is that something new? This kinda of topics come every time something new is in the store and its always the same story: omg everyone will have it...So who cares. Its good thing that atleast when you have to pay for it it looks good, lets face it so far all the mounts there were horrible . I just know some people that wont have the money for this for sure and its bothering me way more then the fact that everyone will have it. There isnt much unique things in wow anymore anyway.

Oh jesus christ. I'm voicing my opinion. If you can't handle that then 
please be offended. I won't lose sleep over the knowledge that you think 
less of me.And to define a bad player, let me answer that question 
with a question.If someone is bad at football, should they win a 
medal or trophy for it? Bad at football is the inability to kick a ball in 
the direction intended, or at all for that matter. For example, of course. 
If someone can't do more than 10k dps on Madness of Deathwing, that's a 
bad player. However, it's not me who said it's a bad thing. You're the one 
who's implied that. People can get better, you know this right? Ergo by 
having something like this as a reward from a particularly challenging 
objective means that there's more incentive to get better. What I mean by 
what I said is that, other than not really raiding heroic mode content, 
there's no incentive to get better at the game if the rewards are handed 
to players despite their ability.

There I agree with you and what i wanted it to say but you said it better. But read some of the posts here ( bad players can have it, everyone will have it) so yes lot of people are upset that everyone will have it and "bad" players will have it, which is just childish and annoying honestly. 
It would be nice if they made this like a reward from doing something during events for MOP, that way everyone who wants it could have it with a bit of "work " in game.

Oh look a MVP praising the mount for being on the store. Sigh. 

Did I say something wrong? 

/confused 

People believe MVPs always agree with Blizzard for some reason. Although I could find numerous threads where they disagree, just without so much whining as other threads. (Not saying this thread has whining) 

Personally I love the mount and don't mind it being on the store. I just won't buy it.

-------------------

There is a war brewing in Syria 
Iran is trolling USA 
There is a huge starvation problem in Africa 

But wait! Hold your horses, biggest news yet, Blizzard is selling a mount in their pet store! Shocking news, this just in; Company wants to earn money. 

Yeah I'm as shocked as everyone else.

-------------------

I can clearly see what the future holds for us, imagine if this type of business was added before? Ashes of Alar ? Blizzstore. Mimirons head? Blizzstore. Invincible? Blizzstore. In MoP we gonna see this trend going stronger and stronger.

Too bad none of those things affect me and its out of my power to influence them, so i don't see how those things are even remotely relevant; basically i'd say that is a dumb argument.

-------------------

Sparklepony: Smallish, semitransparent horse, not related to lore in any real way. 

Winged Guardian: Unexciting bland colourscheme, not related to lore. 

Heart of the Aspects: 
Enormous golden dragon created by the Dragon Soul, the most powerful weapon on Azeroth.

Go to your local trade district. Enormous golden dragons. You can't move, for golden dragons. You can't see for golden dragons. Those poor sods who worked on Heroic Deathwing until their fingers bled? What are they riding? Oh, yeah, you can't see whatever it is (probably some reskin of something else) because it's eclipsed by a dozen golden dragons spawned by the most powerful weapon on Azeroth ($$$). 

I'm not impressed. 

But it's okay everyone. Store items will never have any impact on in game progression, right? This might be the most visually detailed and aesthetically pleasing mount ever made for the game, but it's okay that you have to buy it. It's a mount, and has no bearing at all on the game. 

Those of you who raided for the prestigious items you had to earn? Well you can knock things like Invincible off your future aims. Best mounts are going to be store bought now. 

But it's okay, you can still get the sweet sweet gear. Damn those visuals will be sacrosanct forever, won't they? Blizzard would never even dream of crafting beautiful transmogrification sets which can only be bought in the store, would they? 

Of course not, they have integrity.

-------------------

YAY! I was afraid it'd be made into some 100% drop for a heroic boss! Glad to see it becoming availabe like this, although I had kinda hoped for a 150 mount reward as well...ah well, at least I can enjoy it ^^. And it fits abit better for Horde chars as well than the other 2.

Well, you can't influence this either, so why bother? Do you honestly think Blizzard sees this? Do you think they care? Do you think your - and everyone else's - opinion is more valuable than the revenue they can write down from this sales?

Actually to everyone crying about new model...the Winged Guardian is also unique in movement (running), air animations, sound, /mountspecial and walking. It is unique in many ways so you're a bit late really :). 

Good thing the whining won't change their decision, gonna land me nicely on 140...but I am a bit dissed that it wasn't an 150 achi mount, I really am. I do NOT want a spectral gryphon for that achievement...

GAAAH! This is a 
forum. People are allowed to express their opinions you know. Also I love the irony in your post. 

I didn't read the part where he said it wasn't allowed. I read the whole thing too. He is merely directing his reply on someone else's opinion. Which is allowed as this is a discussion board.

-------------------

The war in Syria. Iran and USA. Starvation and Famine in Africa. Post your thoughts on websites where it's relevant. News websites for example. Real world forums. 

This is a World of Warcraft forum. Sorry for discussing things related to WoW here instead of the above. 

Is that what you call this, a discussion? From what I see it's more a "Either you agree with me or I'll RAWR you to pieces!" kind of , erm, phrasing. 

Sure thing, I might go concern myself about something meaningful, I won't certainly not lose any sleep over this that's for sure. 

Firstly you'll see exactly the same kind of thing when discussing real-world related issues in other places as well. Secondly, I was putting my opinion forward. People have either agreed with what I wrote or personally insulted me. I'm not the one who drew their sword first. In any case, it's clear that unless you post an opinion which doesn't conform with others, you're going to be insulted for it. I wasn't saying that people who don't raid should get things half assed. I was saying that it has no objective related to it. The reward should scale with the effort required. This has no effort required. 

GL with your discussion.

-------------------

.

-------------------

The wowhead discussions on this mount, or specualtion rather highlight everything that is wrong with putting this in the store. 

Upon completing the Madness of Deathwing Fight, I have came to the realization that, what is fired from the Dragon Soul is indeed in the very manifestation of this model: http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/chromaticdragon.jpg , hence, it is the true chromatic dragon, and what is fired off from the Dragon Soul, therefore, this being really special in it looks may be tied with Heroic: Madness of Deathwing in a way that is to be revealed with the patch of 4.3.2 

...and here is the corresponding screenshot: 
http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/6992/chromaticdragon.png 

Regardless of the whole LOL I HAVE A LIFE ME NO WANT TO RAID FOR REWARD/LOL KIDS CAN'T AFFORD MONEY FOR ITEMS arguments, and they are very compelling i'm sure, can none of you appreciate the gravity of putting something that clearly looks to be so central to the game itself on the store?

-------------------

So theyve finally crossed the line of real dev time spent on store items. Good to know for the future. This not being available in game is disgraceful, how can they say stuff like 'we dont have enough artists and time' bull when they do this? 

Saw it coming, but still ridiculous.

-------------------

WHAAAA IT'S PATHETIC 
WHAAAA IT'S ONLY BUYABLE 

Shut. 
Up. 

This mount is perfectly optional and if I'm honest, it looks worth the price compared to the sparkle pony. 

Who gives a damn about WHO has this mount? It's hardly unique and give it a few weeks and it'll vanish from the face of Azeroth like every other buyable item. 

It does not affect gameplay, it is not -needed-, and if you want to be unique just wait a few weeks.

-------------------

Difference is that those are obtainable THROUGH PLAYING THE GAME, while these mounts are about who has the biggest wallet 

Try reading what I was saying before or even my whole post and then come back. That is exactly the problem I have with this, that people need to pay for it as I said in the post you quoted but clearly didnt read. 

To quote myself, the post you just answered to,read the bold part carefully: 

I do not see problem in everyone having this mount either, but 
the fact that you need to pay for it is horrible and so unfair considering how pretty it. Nothing to do with good or bad player.

I really have a problem seeing anything "grave" about the mount being 
obtainable in the store. It's the first time I've contemplated using some 
money on the mount and might in fact do. I'm no fan of buying digital 
products like this but, for 20 euroes I could live with that.Is it 
so that the deep seated need for raiders to show of hasn't disappeared 
from the game yet?

-------------------

It doesn't have a proper ground animation, which leads me to believe that similar models will be coming in MoP that are more polished. Otherwise they just had this design stored up and no idea what to do with it so they chucked it on the store without even putting any effort into that action. 

I guess it's not all bad if MoP sees similiar mounts but it's still a %!!%#@!@ take, though seeing that thing flap along the floor awkwardly has removed all desire for me to buy it on the plus side. 

Is it so that the deep seated need for raiders to show of hasn't disappeared from the game yet? 

I have no problem with store bought items and i've done it several times over several accounts. 

I also don't raid so I would never obtain this mount if it were to be raid gotten. Maybe if it was ever 3 mannable in MoP without being a faceroll we would eventually get there, but otherwise, nope. 

I think that since it clearly is an integral part of this expansions lore it should be a really good reward for completling that expansion, I would gain nothing from it it just doesn't do the mount justice.

-------------------

It's just wrong that the best looking, most unique mount in the game is available in store. This is dirty. You'd of thought perhaps through achievements, or maybe a rare spawn or pvp/pve content.. but no, money shouldn't be able to buy you the sexiest mount in game. 

Utterly rediculous.

Really, no. I think you are over reacting. It's a vanity mount, it isn't 
required for anything. It is there for those who want to buy it and can 
afford to do so. Some people like the look of it and some wont.I

have it. Nor do I hold any frustration about who can buy it.it.

A gorgeous mount. I could buy it, but I refuse to buy any mount or pet from the Blizzard store. Besides, you're not even 'buying' it. The items will always be Blizzard's property, just like every thing WoW related. You pay for the right to use it in-game. It's really lame that they waste such a good design.

On another note: 

I can honestly say that I'd rather have every mount be available to everyone so that I could enjoy them all, than have hard-to-get mounts only a few would be lucky to have and thus me not being able to enjoy them...since by the end of the day, I play this game to enjoy MYSELF, not to e-peen in front of others or have other players e-peen in front of me.

I have no problem with store bought items and i've done it several times over several accounts. I've also been asked already "Oh you want to get it, it can be valentines gifts?" since we share finances I wouldn't buy something without asking, I am in no way saying the following because I am crying over not being able to have it. 

I also don't raid so I would never obtain this mount if it were to be raid gotten. Maybe if it was ever 3 mannable in MoP without being a faceroll we would eventually get there, but otherwise, nope.

And here we are comparing legendaries, BiS-weapons during their prime, to vanity items. Good Job! 

It's nothing like it really, anyone with half a brain could figure out that Shadowmourne during its relevant time had a lot more influence on the gameplay for those that got it than this drake will ever have. Not to mention the vanity items that Shadowmourne rewarded/rewards still when fulfilling the requirements. 

Edit: Oh sorry, I always mistake the 2 (and especially this late at night)...although then I'll change my standpoint to the one of the poster further down. 

In the end, this is just a vanity item...it'll never matter as much as in-game mounts or other in-game items that you use for gameplay, and it being good looking = just makes those that feel excited about it even happier. There are enough rare, epic mounts in-game...and there will surely be even more of them.

-------------------

First off let me say I was more defending a fellow poster rather then the mount. Like others have said, it is just a mount really. Not game changing. However, some of the flames going on in here are really not necessary

I'm talking about Frostmourne, not Shadowmourne. And I'm talking about the story implication, which is to me far more important than any fleeting stats, BiS nonsense. Frostmourne was a central artifact in WotLK. The Heart of the Aspects - the essence of the Dragon Soul - was a central artifact in Cataclysm.

Its not about what the item does one bit. Its the plain and simple fact something which CLEARLY had a lot of dev time put into it, isnt even obtainable by playing the actual game.

This is like selling Frostmourne in the store. It's pathetic, but it's also what I've come to expect. 

Infact, it's so entirely nothing like that at all. 

Frostmourne is an item of lore, that has been in the warcraft universe for years. There is only one Frostmourne and it is unique. 

These dragons on the other hand, have no lore attached to them (compared to frostmourne)and have had no significant impact on the game world. They could easily say these dragons are the most common sight in MoP making your comparison redundant.

-------------------

Lame and dull mount models (lol @ event reward lovebird) in-game, shiny and glittering fancy models in store for cash, there is 
absolutely nothing wrong with this.

-------------------

.

-------------------

People need to shut up whining about it being in the store. 

A company is making money. 
OH JESUS ALERT THE PRESSES. 

If you're disgusted in anyone, it should be the people who are buying it.

Not at all. The Heart of the Aspects is the essence of the Dragon Soul - you actually see it shoot out of the Dragon Soul to destroy Deathwing in the Dragon Soul raid. It's the very incarnation of the power used to the create the Dragon Soul, that's why it's a "chromatic" dragon.

-------------------

The animation of the Heart of the Aspects is WAAY too fast, bops up and down insanely fast. A surefire way to get vertigo. 

Also it would have been nice with a bit more color variation on it, forgettable imo. 

But with the HoA in petstore, its highly likely that the soul of the aspects pet ends up in the store too, maybe even the next sellable guardian cub, huh? think about that.

It's not. The sole vanity reward of the daggers is a parachute 

Lol, those wing thingies? I thought it would be anew thing to reward the guild as well with something for their hard work and the help put into getting the legendary. 

Makes me think of the start in this vid: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6RZBe2Z4fQ

-------------------

Plus the parachute is bound to the daggers.

-------------------

hoping everyone gets one so its super dirt common & annoying, ive no idea why, buying mine to use on allts in a sec.

-------------------

Screw anyone who sais this sucks this is GREAT. İ would glady pay for more mouynts released this way. So much better then farming achivements every week like a sucker this way i will be able to enjoy the game instead of wasting time to get the tool to start enjoying it way to go blizz kudos to you

Yes - it is a vanity item. 

Yes - it does directly integrate with current lore for current content. 

Yes - it is better looking than all of the mounts available through the current content. 

Yes - it should have been the 'Glory of the Dragonsoul Raider' mount. 

No - it does not have a 'direct' impact on gameplay. 

No - it does not provide you with an unfair advantage by spending real life money. 

No - it shouldn't have ended up on the Blizzard store. 

However, I will leave you with a little math; 

20 euros each, a million will sell easily within the month. That's 20 million euros. The design of the mount couldn't have taken more than an afternoon, yes it looks nice, but it is so fundamentally incomplete, missing animations, looks ridiculous at high flying speeds, can't land and run on the ground even though its got legs - it's definitely an afternoon's work. 

That's 20 million euros of pure profit. 

They delayed Diablo 3 recently. 

Cataclysm has been a failure. 

They've lost a million subscribers (ps: 1 million subscribers is ~6mil euros/month). 

Might explain the 'why' of it all. 

PS: some of the earlier "discussion" in this thread is disgusting, and you should be ashamed of yourselves for talking to other people in that way.

It's actually a lot more than a million subscribers, but you summed it up rather nicely. 

The saddest thing is that I'm not even disappointed, it's just what I've come to expect from Blizzard. It's not the same company it used to be, or perhaps my expectations are just higher than before. Either way, they join BioWare on the list of companies I've recently lost all respect for.

As many of you have said, this is the nicest looking mounts in the game. 

I don't think so. Saw a bunch of them in Orgri right now and I don't like it so much: way too shiny. My eyes still hurt :S

-------------------

Those purchased mounts are increasingly gaudy. I don't mind if people have terrible taste and like the looks of this thing, but ffs make it unusable in BGs, it's way too big. You get that huge tail right in the middle of your screen whenever you follow someone using this thing.

-------------------

Nice! 
Cool animation, way to brightly coloured. 

It's great everyone can buy it if they want though, you elitist jerks who doesn't want everyone to have it; no one is looking at you anyway.

I'm not going to lose respect for a games company over making money. If anything I can respect how Blizzard practically have a license to print money at will. 

I do lose respect for a games company who produce poor games though, for example, last year ID software released 'RAGE', which was highly anticipated but turned out to be a nightmare to get to run, and after getting it running it was one of the shortest games ever released. I got a refund for said game, and will never be purchasing another game from ID. 

Or, Blizzard with Dragon Soul, poor instance design, poor mechanics, just plain poor. I signed up for the annual pass for a free copy of Diablo 3. It also means I can get into the MoP BETA and see if its even worth continuing to play WoW. Thus, for Blizzard to retain respect they need to make MoP awesome and not destroy Diablo. Either one of those failing will cause the same reaction that I had to RAGE. 

Adding a mount to game that you can see quite obviously would have been nice to have as a reward for doing something or achieving something in game to the store is not going to ruin it for me, it's a bit of a crappy move, but it's not the end of the world... (of warcraft)

-------------------

As usual I'm obviously missing something. I'm not a raider, I don't expect all the toys you get for not raiding. I do expect to have other choices available however & this is one of them. 

As always it comes down to this, raiders are not more important than other players or vice versa. You choose to raid, so what? Why do you need 'status' as well? It's laughable. 

Get over yourselves & start realizing you are playing a game. If not I shall epeen my pet prowess & fishing skill & demand special presents. 

TLDR: Lordy Lummox, snowflake alert!!

And here we are comparing legendaries, BiS-weapons during their prime, to vanity items. Good Job! 

It's nothing like it really, anyone with half a brain could figure out that Shadowmourne during its relevant time had a lot more influence on the gameplay for those that got it than this drake will ever have. Not to mention the vanity items that Shadowmourne rewarded/rewards still when fulfilling the requirements. 

Edit: Oh sorry, I always mistake the 2 (and especially this late at night)...although then I'll change my standpoint to the one of the poster further down. 

In the end, this is just a vanity item...it'll never matter as much as in-game mounts or other in-game items that you use for gameplay, and it being good looking = just makes those that feel excited about it even happier. There are enough rare, epic mounts in-game...and there will surely be even more of them.

Oh you guys, getting all worked up over some mount :> 

It's not that, it's the principle of the thing. This isn't a reskin like the sparkle horse was of Invincible. This is a new model, new skeleton, new animations, new skin - it's all new. And you don't earn it by playing the game, you buy it for cash. Because it's entirely new, it took development time to make. Time which was evidently not lavished upon the crowning raid of this expansion. Content is no longer being developed to earn, or to experience, but purely to purchase. 

That is what people are getting worked up over.

-------------------

I'm not going to lose respect for a games company over making money. If anything I can respect how Blizzard practically have a license to print money at will. 

It's not even about that, for me. It's about how little respect they have for their own story and their own universe. I wasn't particularily fond of the previous pet store mounts, but at least they were just completely made up. The Heart of the Aspects on the other hand is an important part of lore, literally the incarnation of the power of all the dragon aspects, the very thing used to destroy Deathwing: 

http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/6992/chromaticdragon.png 

And it's being sold in huge numbers for €20. I mean, I'm not going to pretend to be shocked, story was never Blizzard's priority. But they used to show some integrity and internal consistency when it came to their own worlds. In vanilla, dragons were rare and important and every single individual dragon had a unique name and a place in the story. Now, you buy the incarnation of their beings in microtransactions and sit on them in Orgrimmar, hoping that someone will be impressed.

Oh yeah I know it's part of the story, even part of the current story line 
that people are currently working through. With this in mind, it could be 
used as justification both for and against it being on the store if you 
look at the issue objectively.This means that everybody has the 
possibility of a Dragon Soul mount.With Blizzard's recent move 
towards 'everybody should be able to see any of the content regardless of 
how long they play' - which is what LFR is, it really wouldn't surprise me 
if this was the original thought behind putting it on the store. Let's 
face it, you can't 'earn' any of the Dragon Soul mounts through LFR - the 
Ultraxion drop or the Madness drop - they're both specific to Normal mode 
and Heroic mode.

-------------------

From a lore perspective, I do see why this does not seem right, but it is largely not the lore that people care about (sadly); it is the fact that it is a beautiful mount that cannot be earned in-game. But I am certain that MoP mounts are going to be re-skins of this thing. Possibly, better looking ones. Personally I do not really like it's head shape much, but it is obviously a drake based on the Eastern conception of a dragon. So everyone will have the chance to earn something highly similar to it eventually. 

I'll admit, it would have been great as the 150 mount achievement reward, and it would have went perfectly with the equivilent companion pet award. I really do not want another gryphon, spectral or not. But there would undoubtably have been complaints about that too. 

What I really detest is the abuse that people who buy the store mounts, or admit to liking the mounts, get from some people. People are just as entitled to buy the mounts and like them as they are to dislike them.

-------------------

I am genuinely gutted that this is a store mount. I was really prayin this was the reward for the 150 mount ach - selfish I know, but its a deserving mount for all the effort. It is one of the few completely new models of this expansion that has real quality, real detail, real desire to have it and its just given away. Just feels like a waste, but thats my opinion. I can just see when the 150 mount ach finally comes out its just a reskin of a crappy old mount. Please please make the reward a good one.

-------------------

/facepalm to blizzard.

-------------------

Unlocked ingame stuff for money? Turning more and more into Activision by the second. What a disgrace to put the best looking mount of the expansion into a cash vanity item, It would be much more awesome as a reward.

-------------------

Haters gonna hate. Of course it's up there for profit. Blizzard is a company, all companies WANT to make a profit. And frankly it's nice that everyone can get a rather sweet looking mount instead of the no lifers.

A sudden influx of the same mount into the game is a temporary damage to immersion. 

How many of the other mounts do you still see around? Not many. People prefer to be unique and will always go back to something they truly like after the hype. 

WoW being an MMORPG has nothing to do with microtransactions, in fact, such transactions are becoming fairly standard in the genre, if not gaming in genre, to add 'value added services' - such as vanity items.

What is this drivel about "no meaning" coming from? Are people really playing this game only to show off what they have to other players? 

I'm not at all IMPRESSED by for example someone sitting on a firehawk of any kind. It does not have MEANING to me since it's not my own, I can't enjoy it at my own will. Someone else than me getting Firelord or some other title doesn't mean squat to me, since I'm not playing for others and their achievements do not apply to me in any way.

And since when was 
playing the game for the rewards a bad thing? 

I highlighted the key words there. 

Just because you don't raid, that doesn't excuse you from the fact that this is a game. Rewards should come with playing the game and the challenges it has, raiding or not. 

Standing around doing nothing of merit in your faction capital isn't a game. That's a social simulator. Getting amazingly neat perks such as this for not actually playing the game is why people aren't happy. Not the mount itself.

I pass your criteria test, thank you. Likewise, I wonder what goes through the minds of a Blizzard Dev when a new-skinned model and visually awesome mount is nothing more than a cash maker? Why should I put any effort in collecting the old mounts (or any) when the newest model is for money? You could reply and say.."You jelly?" I wouldn't say jelly, just very disappointed in how the latest model cost extra money ontop of a game I already spend £9.99 a month for.

This is just sad. 

For starters the mount looks fantastic. 

Now why would u go and waste this beautiful model in the store and cause all this whining is beyond me. 

I can understand ( although i cannot accept) that you don't wanna ""waste"" such a well designed model and put it in a high raiding achievement , that perhaps ""few"" people would enjoy. Fair enough. 

Why not turn in into somekind of in-game experience? A series of achievements , an incredibly hard questchain , something , anything , whatever u can come up with. If anything it would even bring people back to the game , it would give me a reason to log in. 

But you chose the store. And the funny thing is with everyone buying this in a couple of weeks tops it will lose its glow , and your design will go to the gutter. But at least a giant pile of money will come with it. 

But hey thanks for giving me a reason to avoid farming Deathwing Heroic for the next 6 months , the only reason would have been to distrubute the Life Binder mount. 

So here , take my money..../Spits

How am I not surprised that the first thing I see when I log in in the 
front of Orgrimmar AH, is four of these god damn drakes... Not so unique 
anymore, eh.

Anyone that buys it to be unique is a moron.

-------------------

People really start up riots for the dumbest reasons.

-------------------

Everything that looks good is on the store, reminds me of F2P games. It's really sad what they've come down to. Seems like they've gave up on the game, just trying to earn as much money from it they can with things like these. 

Best decision ever would be to just remove the store and all items from it completely except game time and games. Make items again worth something (other than $$$) by actually having to earn them in game. 

Just pathetic.

-------------------

Blizzard are greedy !@#$% imo why not give players who have played for years a free mount instead of trying to pry yet more money from peoples wallets. I love the look of this mount but i ll be foocked if im gonna buy it. People already pay subs blizzard stop been greedy ^-*!@ and give the players something for free for a change. 

No wonder more and more people are quitting wow every day

-------------------

So now a paid subscription doesn't include everything inside the of WoW?

This is a sub based game, we shouldn't need to pay to get access to ingame items.

-------------------

The mount has been on their website for purchase for a couple of hours now. 

- Yet, I've seen hundreds of people on my realm having it.. And that is just in a matter of hours, on 1 realm. 

Wouldn't surprise me if they sold it x 1.000.000 in a month, that is 20 million euros for them, in a month - you really think they would even consider giving it to you for free?

-------------------

I love all this "ALL THEY DO IS PAY X?! THEY DID NOT EARN IT!!1" 

Pro tip, Earning £17 in the real world is infinitely more impressive than earning anything in a game, ever. 

Finished Devil May Cry 3 on Dante must die mode? Killed the 40 hour boss in FF11? Finished battle Toads?, sorry. The guy who worked for an hour in Tesco's has still achieved more than you. 

Oh and as cool as it is, its not worth £17. Shame its not a BoE like the pet was.

-------------------

Would be great if blizzard actually respected players for there loyalty but no blizzard just wants to pry moeny from peeps for something that with all due respect should be free. @ the very least obtainable in game as part of some grinding or maybe make it so it can be quested for instead of dropping it in the blizz store and peeing players off. Both me and my gf play wow and would both love this mount yet paying subs for 2 accounts every month is hard enough to say the least. Having to fork out nearly 2 months worth of subs each for a mount just isnt right at all. I ll just go back to rift the games more interesting anyway plus i didnt mind paying 5 quid for a mount from there store its a big spider woop dee doo plus i got a mobile banker for a fiver blizz not a trumped up price like yours.

BLIZZ SHOULD GIVE ME FREE STUFF BECAUSE I'M A CUSTOMER AND I'M ENTITLED TO IT BECAUSE I PAY MY SUBSCRIPTION. ALSO GIVE ME A BOX OF KITTENS MADE OF ICE CREAM.

Oh my god, they're adding stuff to the store! HOW DARE THEY DO THAT?

Shouldn't £8.99 - $15.00 per month be enough? I really think micro-transactions are for free to play games. Throw the customers who're fuelling your livelihood a bone once in a while for god's sake.

-------------------

great, another good looking mount gonna be ugly in a week or 2 when half the server got it... awsome job blizz.

-------------------

It's ugly if you ask me. Yes, I can see it has been put a lot of effort to design it, but it's still ugly. Winged guardian looks better. 

Not buying it :O

-------------------

I belive some of the procedings go towards a certain charity im not too sure though but posative it does so some good comes from it.

-------------------

Sorry blizzard but your judgment has been clouded in greed. Very bad decision, and it begs the question what other more unique mounts will be paid? Disappointed...

Well all know any1 who buy this mount is a noob, it will be like with TRH/TRL, you will be just laughed at :(

They sure didn't have resources to make some new models for DS bosses. Or a new (not another reskin of Vanilla drake) model for the rare Ultraxion mount.

not another reskin of Vanilla drake 

It's not even a reskin. It's the same texture and model of Gyth from UBRS.

-------------------

No landed animation? Ruined.

-------------------

My bad, used "reskin" as "retexture". Still, that is very disappointing. If there was a way to get this mount as a drop, I would grind DS (or, say, Bronze Sanctum) on all my alts.

-------------------

Just wait until they take experence from the Diablo 3 rl cash-for-items model and implement it to WoW during MoP. 

In short, this is what monopoly gives you 

Its a pretty mount, but the price represents hard profit.. and like someone suggested in another post, the income does not go to charity :) (in this case)

Ok, I bought it straight away and I love it. But this is by far the coolest model in game, 
All good and fine. But the problem is ,you will now see thousands others with it. 
i don't mind players having it ofc. But the more common as it is ,the more Charm it lose. You know what i mean.

-------------------

well fact is, it's just a game! you'll lose anything you achieved anyway in a few years when they release their new game and dont bring any new content to WoW and shut their servers down. So just buy it and Support Blizzard, or dont. As long they are not adding stuff like "Upgrade Protection Scrolls ultra+10 to the max" or "Expierence x5000" or something that bring you benefits in gear and gameplay, im fine.

-------------------

Shame on blizz.Why don't you just put all items, materials, weapons, armor, trinkets, achievements, available in game into the !@#$ store...

-------------------

Disgusting

-------------------

store again? lame....

-------------------

I know I will never get anywhere NEAR 150 mounts. But this totally deserved to be the reward for that. It's arguably the nicest mount I've seen in WoW, and making it available for everyone for 20 euros is just horrible. Blizzard, this wasn't even necessary. Making it the 150 mounts reward would ensure that it goes to people who deserve it. 

Disappointed in you Blizzard. Really, really disappointed.

-------------------

Wow, Blizzard. After all the talk about how your resources can't be spent on new boss models in DS you put up this at the store? I guess the customers only paying the monthly fee, all the expansions and the game are just some kind of second class players to you. I'm disgusted by your methods to be honest. 

What's even worse is that this model is probably something you've developed for MoP, maybe some rep grind reward á la Tol Barad, and then you first release it as a store mount and make practically free money.

Agree with this comment. Blizzard's message is; gone are the days of 
special little snowflakes. You want a cool mount? Come buy it. Blizz are 
in business for profit, not charity or special treatment to the select few 
elite. They cater to every single one of their accounts worldwide.

This is the biggest BS I ever heard. 

You think making 20 buck is empressive? 

You must go mental when somebody makes 100 bucks then.

-------------------

This action just proves to us ONE more time that blizzard is just a company genuinely interested in just profit,profit,profit,while not giving A CRAP about players and how they feel ingame. 

Im just sad about those poor blues and those butt licking greens that will have to defend them once again in this HORRIBLE decision

-------------------

People so mad. If u have problems with money -> play less, work more (or get a job). Don't wanna pay for pixel -> stop the whine. Eventually all your hard ("hard") work in this game will be the ash, you have to admit that game can't last forever. And yes, it's a game. Have fun, stop your cry.

-------------------

Whine whine whine, moan, moan, moan. I'm gonna quit the game over an optional mount because it's available to people who can use a credit card so my fragile, hyper-extended ego will be destroyed like a statue made of bread crumbs in a park full of ravenous pigeons. 

... Seriously? You people couldn't be bothered just grind for those old mounts from the really old content no one bothers to go after anymore, making them a rare sight in cities? Is the love rocket not quite rare enough for your fancy with it's 0.14 drop chance? 

Is this going to kill any sense of community like the looking for group feature did because people happen to share a common interest in a £17, really nice looking mount? 

Or are you people just complaining for the sake of it because you're really easily bored and like to complain about trivial things and think it's unfair that people who asked for a not so lazy blizzard store mount actually got what they wanted?

-------------------

blizzard seems to not care anymore about the community,just only the money they get.....and they begin to more greedy too as it wouldnt be enought that we pay every 2 month 25euro and some ppl (including me) haved moved over servers and done factionchanges / race changes...this was just dumb of blizzard to do -_- 

And i forgot: its a damn waste of money

What has an optional mount on the blizzard pet store got to do with the community not being listened to? 
... If I recall, the community -demanded- that blizzard took the time and effort to put something in the store that wasn't just a recolour of invincible or a gryphon with a lion head strapped onto it. 
And they did... yet people still complain about trivial, optional things that are paid for by other people who are under no obligation from hipster egotists on the internet telling them how to spend something as small as £17.

I'd just like to say that I wouldn't be as hurt by this if some of the newer models that require a little bit of dedication and work for like the new lovebird and stuff like darkmoon mounts actually looked cool. But the fact that those suck (imo) and something that looks as if it has had a tonne of work put into it and only requires what took a frantic orc 30 secs to buy off blizz store is in a way killing an aspect of the game I am fond of (farming mounts). Can't blizz start putting crap like the swift lovebird and recoloured models in the blizz store instead? 
You are so right. 

I have some pretty rare mounts (Azure Drake, Rivendare's Deathcharger, Raven Lord) but NONE of them compare to this mount. It's so stupid how such a cool model has been wasted (And I have already seen people /spit on people with the mount in game). It could have been an achievement which we had to work for, instead no. Buy able on the store by level 20s. Proves the point of people that left, that Blizz are money whoring. 

Very disappointed.

-------------------

it's all about money and i don't think is funny... that's why it looks better then what we can get ingame. Where's your respect Blizzard, I am sorry that I have agreed to the annual pass subscription, you don't deserve me, honestly!

It looks nice, that's enough for me. 

Besides, all you raiders got the awesome looking mounts from Firelands. 

I don't raid, but I still want to be able to get good looking mounts.

Would love to have it but sadly i think its to much money for a mount. 
At this moment i can use it better for irl then just a mount.

Give it a couple of months. Hopefully if it's not limited time, you'll be able to get it on sale like the celestial steed is! =)

-------------------

Wasted?! Disgrace?! You hardcore raiders/rare mount campers! I'm thrilled something worthwile and beautiful is available to 
all for a change! What the hell is wrong with you that keep going on and on about it not being unique or available to only a few... I love it and i bought it. Now ppl that doesn't have time to spend days farming for rares can have something pretty to ride around on. And enjoy it for as long as you can because on Pandaria there is no flying until max level lol Also what the hell is wrong with Blizz getting some profit? It is that profit that allows them to do awsome stuff for us all the time. Guys...you sound very much like spoiled brats. I'm gonna ride my gorgeous mount and enjoy it, and frankly i don't care that more ppl have it. I don't envy other their good fortune and i don't begrudge Blizz getting some cash either. I think they had lots of fun creating this mount and have you ever seen a single iota of Blizzcon feeds you would never ever call any of those ppl greedy! I never seen such dedication or passion in any team of workers. We are the reason they get to do their hobby as a job, but we're not the boss of them. Maybe because you pay a monthly fee you think so. You pay monthly to get a newspaper too... Just saying.

-------------------

This mount is to much "china" for my taste. This mount should have been added into MoP lore, instead of the crappy blizzstore in this peroid of time.

-------------------

@4e7649459969fda1-> some people, including myself don't have money to buy the mount so I am discriminated, now you lack some brain and while it is in your rights to have an opinion try to learn how to make some sense out of it for the sake of post limit.

e little kid too

No, he's getting **** for the rest of the life because he's always been a polarizing poster who either you agree with or you hate, because he's a dismissive dick and thinks he's always right about everything. 

So yeah, if the way you want to play this game is within his personal agenda, I guess he's cool, otherwise he wants everything you play to suck so that he wins every game from then on AND HE WANTS IT RIGHT NOW AND YOU BETTER NOT SAY OTHERWISE.

Pretty much this, he is a decent player, have to be to hit challenger, but he is so far up his own ass it hurts.

Tbh, fd897c3091b5bee1 really is a ****ter, but this whole hate

I'd rather not do that, because he's not so bad of a poster that he's just straight up wrong all the time. He does bring up valid points from time to time. 

Blacklisting people who I don't agree with seems kind of narrow minded and stupid to me.

wow took you long enough to do some research. which i'm not going to 
bother acknowledging because you said "tiamat was not in season 1"which 
is straight up wrong. you said nothing about the bug not being in season 1 
therefore you're wrong. learn to formulate a correct argument. also, i 
said it in my first post and across multiple of my posts that i don't give 
a **** if it's fd897c3091b5bee1 or someone else. you're probably the most 
retarded fa ggot in this thread.also, stay down? you have 
to get me down before i can stay that way first. i repeat, you're 
probably the most retarded shitposting faggot in this thread.

Hey Everyone,  Over the last couple of days, many of you have experienced some problems while playing the game. YouÂve seen reconnect spikes, issues with game starts, and very large login queue in many occasions. We wanted to take some time to give you all a little more information on whatÂs going on, since we havenÂt spoken much about this since the issues started occurring.   In the last couple weeks our datacenter and game have been the target of some DDOS attacks. The results of these attacks have caused instability in our service. WeÂve been experiencing large attacks that have been filling up a significant chunk of bandwidth and causing parts of our system to lose connection to each other. The end result is a poor play experience for you all. While weÂve been able to turn on our loss forgiven feature as soon as the attack is detected, this does not equal a good play experience.   While we canÂt share the details of the work we are doing internally to combat this (since it would give the attackers information to circumvent it), we want you to know that we are tackling this from many different angles. This includes working with our datacenter and internet service provider partners, as well as developing tools and services internally to make our service more robust against these types of attacks. Defending against DDOS attacks is an arms race that we will always be engaged in, and we are committed to reducing the pain you all feel as swiftly as possible when the service is being impacted by malicious attacks.  We want you to know that this is the top priority for the Live Services team. We share your frustration at the impact of these attacks, and we are working to make sure you can play the game every time you want to.   -Ryan

Why can't you actually try to fix the servers? This is one of the reasons your company is horrible.

As glad as I am to hear you finally addressing this, this is such a typical response. "We're working on it."

It's not "recent" if it has been happening for a month.

no east coast servers and you are charging 20$ to transfer to LAN  can you give us a update on this please?

I didn't want to believe it was DDOS attacks until i heard something official from Riot on this, but i guess we all know now.  Thanks for the update.

For months now, some players have been using DDoS style attacks to take down individual games, players and servers to avoid losing games. Whilst this affects a small percentage of total games, it has impacted a lot of players, and it's something we'd like to minimize as much as possible. 

Our team has identified many individuals behind such attacks, and we have begun taking actions to limit their access to League of Legends through suspensions and permanent bans. 

And this post was made in April. It's now August.

Great to hear you guys say something about it. Its very reassuring that Riot isn't just panicking and looking for excuses.

if you want to help get better at loss forgiven. When I'm in my promos and i get a loss forgiven, i still get a loss. Fix this issue and you will have many happy people.

-------------------

Well, addressing it is a start, but this is nothing new. It's just been happening more frequently lately.

-------------------

We have heard this all before. Problems continue to happen and promises about an upcoming fix continue to be made without being met.

Hey, in related news, I downloaded DoTa 2 and have been playing with 30 ping from South Carolina, it's tons of fun! Well maybe not tons, since that game is significantly slower, but it's fun to not lag and dc and all of that! #WaitingOnDeadbreed

Yes, those were isolated individual incidents where a single game or a single person was impacted. So they posted in that regard. 

This time the incident is dedicated attacks on their data centres and servers, so they're affecting the entire region - so they're letting us know about it.

-------------------

how come you can't protect your servers

This must explain why the que times are a little long to get into game.    Hope everything works out for you (Riot) in the end!

What about the instability over the past 2-3 months. I understand the recent DDOSing, but what about the months that preceded it?

-------------------

maybe you should have spread the servers out over the continent so that if one data center was getting ddos'd it would only affect a few people instead of all of us. it's your own fault for having such a bad setup.

i hope this keeps happening personally. if i could pay these people to keep the ddos's up i would. maybe it would convince riot to spread the servers out around the continent, like they should have been from day one.

Not sure where you've been, but this has been impacting the servers too 
for months now. Maybe it wasn't everyday, but I sure as hell remember when 
the entire servers would go down and someone's twitter was linked on the 
forums saying they caused it. This is not new and it's been an annoyance 
for MONTHSSigh. I don't even care anymore. I'm just disappointed 
that it's still happening after all of this time to the point where it's 
even more frequent.

Thank you for showing that you care about us.

Why didn't this information come out sooner? You guys seem pretty aware of what it is, and I doubt this is the first time you've all acknowledged it or something, seems like you're giving us info later for no reason...

-------------------

There really needs to be a way to detect who is actually sending these attacks. That'd be about the only way to deal with the problem as I see it. That's far easier said than done though.

To put this into prespective, 

World of Warcraft is also experiencing the same ddos attack issues as we are currently. 

Think about it. WOW, which has been up for years, which requires you to pay in order to play their game, still to this day experiences attacks. 

Its not something you can solve in months, or even years. Its the infrastructure that is already set in place that is inherently flawed and Riot can't do anything about it. 

And if you ask why other places are not attacked, and it seems like its just league, just remember, these people are doing it because they think its fun to rustle the jimmies of such a large online community like League of Legends, because it will cause the most reactions online than most other communities. Reading our reactions and our anger and our protests makes them feel good because they have nothing better to do. They like reading the outrage online, while they post on their twitter proudly.

This thread provided literally the same exact amount of "information" as all of their previous posts. They didn't address East Coast / Central servers, compensation, how long it's estimated to take for DDOS attacks to successfully be prevented, etc..

-------------------

So just to clarify for everyone, the attacks referred to in the stickied post by 5e67716a07f4200d are a very different issue. Those are the drop hack attacks that have been impacting individual servers and games. What we're posting about here are the issues we've been having over the last week or so have been much larger and have impacted almost every player on the game when the attacks occur.   While we've been able to take steps to improve the drophack issue, these new sets off DDOS's that have been impacting us require different tactics.

Must be nice for you. However I'm ****ing tired of trying to play this game and having someone be dropped or getting trapped in a non existing game. Or the constant clipping the game seems to have now. Or the constant 120 ping (used to be 90 a season ago). Just because your lucky doesn't mean it doesnt exist. If it didn't exist there wouldn't be so much outrage about. So kindly stfu and leave your opinions to yourself.

New servers aren't going to prevent a DDOS attack. That would only give the attackers a new target. 

Also, as Ryan said, DDOS attacks are an arms race. As defenses get better, so do attacks, and new methods of attacks are developed just as the old ones are defended against. It's a never ending game of cat and mouse.

What we're posting about here are the issues we've been having over the last week or so have been much larger and have impacted almost every player on the game when the attacks occur. 

While we've been able to take steps to improve the drophack issue, these new sets off DDOS's that have been impacting us require different tactics. 

Again what about the server instability for the past 2-3 months? It's just not the recent DDOS. The forums have been complaining about it forever now, and no one seems to say a single thing about it. Just even noticing this problem and acknowledging it would be nice.

it would make my day if you'd admit that having all of the servers an data centers in one place was a horrible business decision.

This thread provided literally the same exact amount of "information" as all of their previous posts. They didn't address East Coast / Central servers, compensation, how long it's estimated to take for DDOS attacks to successfully be prevented, etc.. 

East Coast or Central servers won't help this particular type of attack. These are pipefilling attacks that cut off the ability for services to talk to one another. The location of our servers has very little impact on the ability to execute that type of attack. 

As mentioned before, DDOS prevention is an arms race. We've done a number of things to make our game more resilient to many of the types we've experienced over the years. There are many things we can do to prevent some DDOS's, but those prevention methods also have a major negative impact on the play experience for everyone. It impacts our ability to give solid timelines. We also shy away from the timelines in this instance because we don't want to give information out to potential attackers.

New servers aren't going to prevent a DDOS attack. That would only give the attackers a new target. 

Also, as Ryan said, DDOS attacks are an arms race. As defenses get better, so do attacks, and new methods of attacks are developed just as the old ones are defended against. It's a never ending game of cat and mouse. 

I never suggested that they implement new servers to resolve DDOS attacks. I was talking about server issues outside of DDOS attacks that have been going on for too long and were never addressed.

Still wondering what the excuse is for the past couple months before the DDOS attacks started.

Approx 10 hours until Lizard Squad takes League down again and Riot does nothing about it (they've been doing it at the same time every night, COME ON GUYS).  Also, this:   1052968

You know Riot, DDOS Attacks are from internet terrorists who use it as a form of protesting, it is not like it is a force of nature that randomly spawns and we have no control over it, maybe if you guys didn't neglect everything since Beta things wouldn't be as bad...You guys make promises time and time again but provide no information about it and have yet to follow through with one upgrade to this game for over five years. What is your solution to this? More 10-20 dollar skins. Why is THIS game singled out and targeted exclusively? I don't see anyone complaining about it on other games as much as you guys do.

No one sensible is doubting you guys. You've got a tough ****ing job. 

No one sensible believes them. DDoS attacks are a fact of life. They happen. But you take steps to mitigate the issue. Of course that requires you to spend money on better infrastructure. That includes having multiple locations for servers, redundancy, ISPs that have real DDoS prevention, etc. If your business partners can't do their job, you kick their ass to the curb and get someone who can. 

Valve doesn't have this many problems and they have a fraction of the resources. Riot is a Tencent company. They can afford infrastructure that rivals Google/Facebook with ease. 

Riot is 100% responsible for failing to deal with these DDoS attacks. I don't now of any other companies that would put up with this level of poor performance.

Targets of Lizard Squad include: 
LoL 
Runescape (Seriously guys?) 
Battle.net (WoW and Hearthstone) 
Guild Wars 2 
Eve Online 
ic3.gov 
fbi.gov 
Brazzers (A freaking porn site guys?) 

Lizard Squad are doing this to any site or service requested by their followers on Twitter. They are not "hacktivists", they are trolls. Also, DDoS is pretty hard to defend yourself from considering how it's constantly being improved.

You're a ****ing idiot. That would be because it's the single most popular game in the world. That makes it the best target. The teams making content also have nothing to do with network issues, and in fact, if you try to take artists, or even programmers who aren't experienced enough with network programming and stick them on this issue, it will not help. This issue isn't just a riot issue, but an issue for the ENTIRE infrastructure of the internet. 

Do you realize how much data 200-400 gbps is? Most connection speeds are in the range of 10-40mbps. That's a difference of about 10000x. Imagine that's all being written to your computer's hard drive. That 1tb hard disk you have is filled theoretically, in under 3s, and that's assuming you can even write that fast or your cpu can process data that fast (it can't). This is a massive amount of trash data on a scale you can't comprehend, and this issue is far bigger than riot. This issue is a result of poor infrastructure, a lack of good ways to persecute the people behind the attacks, and the fact that all of that information being sent still has to be filtered out at some point without ****ing your in game ping. All of that processing takes time, and the ddos attacks significantly increase the traffic on the network to the point where having enough processing power to handle peak hours several times over doesn't cut it.

how many new servers would have to be implemented to stop this? Is that even an option? I'm just saying let's pretend there's 10 million people on in peak hours and they have capacity for 15 million, if they purchased servers to accommodate 50 million people (or rather more data), would it do anything?

d560eb18682e36cc:

We are sorry for the ongoing server issues in many parts of the 
world including very recent North America and Europe problems. Lots 
of work has been done to help improve things and more work is still 
being done.We have seen significant increases in hackers 
running distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) 
against game and platform servers. League of Legends has not been 
the only target, most large game companies have been feeling the 
pain along with other online businesses, but we have been a more 
frequent target than most. In the last 6 months over half of all 
DDoS attacks we have seen against LoL have been in the last 2 
months. We are currently seeing 2 to 4 attacks every day against one 
or more regions. The strength of these attacks has increased 
significantly over the last few months as the arms race against 
hackers continues to grow in scale.League of Legends is made 
up of dozens of components, some of these are easier to protect 
against DDoS than others. Typically websites are easiest to protect, 
while game servers are hardest (most standard forms of protection 
would create lag in game like League of Legends).In the last 
2 weeks world record breaking DDoS attacks ( http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks-and-breaches/ddos-attack-hits-400-gbit-s-breaks-record/d/d-id/1113787) 
have been seen by several companies including Riot. These attacks 
are so big that the ISPs and Telecom's that service League of 
Legends have not been able to keep their Internet circuits up while 
the attack is underway. This means that our servers often do not 
even see or feel the malicious traffic itself because the Internet 
connections feeding our data centers are being cut off due to the 
size of the attacks filling the very large Internet circuits the 
telecoms and ISPs have.When our data centers lose the 
Internet, your connections to game servers and/or PVP.net services 
like Chat and Login get disconnected in the worst case or lots of 
players will see serious in-game lag for the duration of the attack. 
If lots of players get disconnected, you will often see a login 
queue to get back into PVP.net or the game.We expect the 
current attacks to get better soon. We already have been able to 
fend off many problems before they create problems for you. Our 
network team has been working almost non-stop for several weeks both 
fighting off DDoS attacks around the world and strengthening our 
Internet services. We have also been working with telecoms and ISPs 
to help them understand how to block these attacks so that their 
services are not affected. Some fixes have required new equipment 
and ISP circuits to be ordered which can take weeks to get shipped 
and installed. Some telecoms and ISPs are slower than others in 
applying the fixes needed to ensure they do not fall over from these 
attacks, we depend on many ISPs so its important that all ISPs make 
the fix or the bad traffic finds a way to knock off our servers.Of 
course this is an arms race so as one defense gets put in place, 
eventually we can expect new methods to launch attacks that will 
often require time to put a defense in place. About half of the 
equipment investment in League of Legends is network gear with a 
large part of that in place to just handle the ongoing rise in 
frequency and size of DDoS attacks. We are investing even more every 
day around the world and will continue to work hard to win the 
fight. We are also working closely with our equipment providers and 
other services to make sure we are doing everything we can to 
protect the many components that make up League of Legends.Sometimes 
we lose the fight and that sucks because it means players like you 
feel the pain too. It also means that instead of our engineers 
building cool stuff for players we have to fight off bad stuff from 
hackers, so players lose again. It's frustrating, but the reality of 
large scale Internet services, so we have to get smarter and better 
to make sure players around the world can have fun when you want to 
have fun.I apologize for the pain and promise that we will 
continue to get better. New data centers with stronger and even more 
Internet connections are getting close to being live for Europe and 
North American players, with all other regions scheduled for 
complete overhauls as 2014 goes on. These new data centers will help 
us keep up the fight in the hacker arms race, they won't solve all 
the problems we deal with all the time, but they should level up our 
side of the fight a great deal.In the meantime we are not 
helpless, teams are still working long hours, expect daily 
improvement.See you on the Fields of Justice,d560eb18682e36ccVP 
of Network OperationsRiot GamesP.S. for the more 
technically curious here is some background reading on the current 
attacks:http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/the-new-normal-200-400-gbps-ddos-attacks/

Work has been underway on NA for many months. We need to get EUW on 
our new architecture and make sure we have it baked into our 
automation. Then on to NA and EUN. Should start to see better 
network to game servers real soon. Also we are working on improving 
ping time for NA East Coast players. Cool things coming.

Quote:

d560eb18682e36cc:

We have several connections to the Internet going to the NA game 
server pool, so a DDoS does not always kick all players off our 
network and some will see various levels of lag while some will see 
nothing (though might still have their game ruined as other players 
in at are impacted).Work is being done to try to improve the 
system that manages ranked games and loss forgiven. We have smart 
teams who are focused on improving the experience of players who get 
hammered when bad things happen to the network or servers. It's 
complex and tricky to nail the balance on this, think about all the 
players who may have completed a game with no issue and won, they 
are not going to be happy if we roll back that win (and depending on 
the luck of the draw that win could be yours while someone else is 
getting the bad end of an DDoS attack or when we make a mistake in 
our data centers).Not impossible to improve on this, but it 
takes time, lots of angst here at Riot on figuring out how to make 
this as fair as possible.

We are in agreement that we have been slow to get messaging out on 
this, the team has come up with a new process that includes a forum 
post by the system admin or network admin who responds to an issue 
for every live service fix. Hold us accountable, we are going to get 
better at this.

d560eb18682e36cc:

Moving servers more central for all NA players is a priority. As I 
mentioned earlier, truck loads of servers are purchased, we just 
need to lock down the data center contract and get the Internet 
circuits installed. In the meantime the servers near Portland, OR 
will see connection improvement for many players as the direct 
connections to the major ISPs and telcos get installed (more are 
getting hooked up every week). We were maxed out of quality space, 
Internet bandwidth, and power in the Los Angeles area so Oregon was 
the best choice at the time to get large amounts of servers up and 
running (Facebook, Apple and a few other major players are an easy 
drive away), it is technically only 7-9 msec further away from the 
LA area (if LA was the better place, it is not for all players) but 
we need to optimize the routing and circuit mix to really achieve 
the best possible connection for all players to the Oregon located 
servers. The team is working long hours to get this done.In 
the last few months many players were likely getting first routed to 
LA then to Portland through San Jose or sometime weirdly through 
Seattle. Now lots of players are taking a much more direct route to 
just San Jose and then Portland if you are not in the Southwest USA 
or you will likely pass through Seattle then to Portland if you are 
in the Northwest USA or coming out of most of Canada. So ping time 
for many players should have gone down in the last month (but not 
for all). This will continue to optimize for more players as we get 
more telcos and ISPs directly connected.Another team is 
focused on getting game servers spun up more centrally which will 
then allow Oregon to become the fall back site if things go into the 
ditch in a bad way (something we have not had as option in the 
past). So net, Oregon is a temporary hop which has allowed us to 
significantly expand the number of game servers and other resources 
we have needed to help stabilize NA. Next step is to optimize ping 
time for as many players as we can in Oregon and then a more central 
to NA location which we will tell you about as soon as we lock it 
down.-d560eb18682e36cc

-------------------

this is off topic but since ff48fd6c3240b537 is around an reading this thread, an seems to know about the networking side of this game. when can we expect you to spend the money we spend on your game an give us centralized and/or east coast servers? LoL is the only popular game i can think of that doesn't cater to both coasts of North America. i know i'm sick of being punished with an unplayable ping b/c i don't live in cali. maybe you can check out the 970+page east coast server thread an give us an long over due update.

its honestly riot is just too greedy. they haven't answered anybody they haven't done anything about the losses people are getting because of it. I honestly just dont even care anymore. to give you guys a bigger insight on howmuch they dont care i found out that the attacks they're use to take down the servers aren't even full force of what they're going to do. all i can say is rip riot.

-------------------

Dear Riot,  I appreciate the hard work you guys are doing for us.  After facing the bugsplat, I figured I'd uninstall the game then re-install it.  I deleted every single file of LOL and downloaded the game again from the website (and i wish i hadn't done that) then proceeded with the installation, after it finished the client didnt want to open and I just got the logo that appears before the client opens. please find it attached below.   1053033  I dont really know what to do.  Any suggestions ?!  Thank you and Your assistance is highly appreciated

This post was ABSOLUTELY pointless.   "servers are being DDoSed" yeah, we know.  "We are taking steps to prevent this but we can't tell you anything about it or when it should be better" Ok, I'll expect the servers to be better in 2019 then.

I had no idea there was even DDoS attacks going on, the servers were acting the way they've always acted for me.

Game is literally unplayable right now. Random times I'll just sit there and auto. doesn't seem to affect anyone else, connection only goes down while I play league. Anyone else have this problem?

These services may be successful for other games, but there's one thing you have to take into consideration. Any time you add a DDoS protection to a network, you have to consider the implications of doing so. 

We're already in the process of adding multiple different levels of protection, but each step of the way, we have to ensure that we've accurately tested these services. If we didn't test them thoroughly, we could shoot ourselves in the foot before we even start protecting our servers. One large problem we've seen is once we turn on mitigation, latency increases by a large amount. With this latency increase you have essentially taken down the service yourself. 

Another thing that I've mentioned in previous threads is that when you have such large attacks against your network, you have to work with many different ISPs/groups to ensure traffic is being properly blocked. I can't give too much detail, but this is something we're always actively doing, as well as making network changes to give us more control over our network service as a whole. 

If there are any specific questions, I'll do my best to answer them, but remember, one of the reasons we can't share a lot about what we're doing is because it's always a game of cat and mouse. We don't want to show our hands about our defense, just as much as the attackers don't want to share too much about their attacks.

you guys are all over this ddosing but won't provide us with east coast servers

-------------------

they probably wouldn't be getting attacked if they had servers/datacenters spread out throughout the continent so everyone had a quality gaming experience. it's pretty clear people love this game b/c so many people play it regardless, but if you read these forums a lot of people are upset they don't get the same quality experience the minority on the west coast enjoy.

-------------------

maybe the people who got banned did it O.O ..or maybe... http://beforeitsnews.com/contributor/upload/8435/images/Illuminati100.jpg

Welp, **** happens. Work on it right, I know you're doing all that you can.

Thanks for the notice. It's been a frustrating couple of day. Keep doing what you do.

Servers are so rachet fix this bull

-------------------

what about the when in game the game crash while im playing and their was no lag nothing and its to where i have to exit it by task manger and it wont let me re open league it keep saying update fail but their was no update?? so whats going on?

-------------------

Why is it in the past few years ddos attacks have become so common. A few years ago they were around, but no where near as popular as they are now :/.

Are you guys on-call? Do you have to get up at 12am and fix the server when it's being attacked at night? How does that work? 

Is there a place we can shoot an email/tweet/etc when it happens to speed up the process?

I get the impression your jobs aren't always easy, I would just like to say that we appreciate the work you do. (even though I use the EU servers)  If you have a stressful day, a hot meal and something warm to drink can make a huge difference to the workplace atmosphere.   Leaving a glass cannister(?) of hard candy (?) open in the office can also make a rather significant impact, best of luck. http://www.unique-gifts-for-her.com/images/hard_candy.jpg  Disclaimer, not sure if the correct word is 'hard candy' but I left a picture just in case.

I would usually be right there with you, but we're seeing the kind of attacks US military bases see to try and hijack satellites to steal weapons and combat strategy information...if you watch the attacks live it's pretty intense, 

yes they should have more money into servers...but when you compare say WoW to this, they have been running a lot longer, and people didn't have as fast of internet back when WoW was 4 years old, either way, Riot will hopefully grow the quality of the servers and have more backups and it will get better

Dump your Amazon traffic. 

That's an interesting vulnerability, but it's not really specific to only DDoSing Amazon related services. Essentially people left an exploitable service open to the Internet instead of properly firewalling it off, and then attackers were using those pwnd Amazon instances to DDoS other things on the Internet.

3 hours until Lizard Squad DDOSes Riot again if they follow the same pattern they have the past 3 days.

This DDos issue is MUCH higher priority than East Coast. Coming from an East Coastian, patience my friend...patience

-------------------

Well I have not gotten any lag issues in any of my games but I have gotten a nice big 4 wins half LP and 0 losses prevented. Thanks DDOSers.

-------------------

Loss forgiven, but still counts against my provisional...

-------------------

I am confused why everyone is surprised, or in disbelief over DDOS attacks. Not that long ago World of Warcraft had the same problem, a huge influx of them. I guess that was what it was right from the start. What I *am* surprised by is how these attacks have been around forever and no one defends against them from the get go. You would think getting setup with servers now a days would have something out of the box for this. Regardless of how, or why, the fact there is quite a bit of money exchanging hands with 16 million subscribers, even on a pay to play system (At last read, ESPECIALLY on a pay to play system, meaning they often make more than a subscription based game). And yet, where is all that money when it comes to additional servers needed elsewhere, mirrors servers? backups? defenses against this. Perhaps taking a cue from other large game companies in both network security, remediation and financial responsibility when it comes to infrastructure? Its bad form.

-------------------

always -.- riot have to give us rp free for the problems...

-------------------

Soooo, I have to be THAT guy and ask, but are the servers unavailable for anyone else rn?

-------------------

https://twitter.com/LizardSquad/with_replies  Just putting this here in case it hasn't all ready been pointed out to the powers that be !

-------------------

I have faith in you riot i know you are trying hard around the clock to fix these issues thank you for your hard work gl <3

-------------------

People are so evil. They are probably doing this cause they have loss so many game and don't have anything better to do in their life.

-------------------

Was in a ranked match and boom the chat server goes down and then i get kicked and cant log back in WTF riot what about those who were in a middle of a ranked match and we go down in rank. Not fair at all to penalize us for you not having your servers secure.

-------------------

Do these problems extend to logging into the game? My internet is fine but when connecting to the game it goes through three attempts to contacting the servers and then ends up kicking me out. Please anyone with an answer let me know

-------------------

Yall got dis, keep up the good work.

-------------------

Well despite all the negativity on here, I for one am glad that Riot is tackling the issue. In case you guys forgot, this League of Legends is FREE. Nobody is forced to pay to play this game. I am just happy that they recognize there is an issue and that it is in the process of getting fixed. Riot doesn't owe anybody anything. Just have some patience and let them do what they do. NA will be back online in no time.

-------------------

Riot i hope you guys take these people out. the Lizard squad are a sick bunch of people and i wish you guys can talk to other game companies on to how you guys can combat these fiends. Plz rate up if you want these guys in prison.

-------------------

62f4a2dd85f811f1, when I launch LoL on my laptop it just goes through the loading/update screen and the PLAY button isn't illuminated orange so I am unable to click on it. It basically just loads the game I guess and sits idle. I'm not even at the login screen.

-------------------

didnt get loss prevented for my game. gg riot gg

this hasnt affected me at all on the east coast, im guessing its hitting ISPs in your area. Which is why it gets its own little thread.

No they are attacking data centers and according to their twitter the chat server (though I'm not buying that one). So it isn't possible you weren't affected. Unless you have such a horrible net connection that you can normally barely play.

-------------------

The fact that you guys are getting targeted so much should give you encouragement that you made such a great game that everyone else is trying to drag you down.

-------------------

I couldn't bother reading all 15 pages of this thread but all you attacking riot is ridiculous. Obviously some kids with abandonment issues are hacking the servers to get this exact kind of response and honestly the servers were only down for a short while..so congratulations 'terrorist'. They will be found out eventually, don't worry about it.

-------------------

@5e67716a07f4200d  Rather off topic, but what I was wondering if you could share is how you got into the line of work that you do now? I'm currently an undergrad in Computer Science, and while I'm learning a lot, data security, and cyber security are where my major interests lie. Any pointers?

The group doing this literally said they just targeted the chat service and happened to knock out the whole system. When they actually try to take the whole thing down, they do. As we've seen in the past few days.

Is this a joke? Your attacker literally tells you hours before they attack. Lizard squad twitter. Check it out.

-------------------

Yeah but everybody is only feeding into it. They want to cause a huge commotion and if it does they succeeded and are happy about it. Just ignore the kids. I'm sure Riot doesn't want this to happen any more than the rest of us.

-------------------

Random question: These hackers are bragging about what they did on a twitter account. Are you not able to work with Twitter and track down where their IP is coming from? I know they're probably using proxies to access the internet from that account, but can you still not track them down?

-------------------

Its probably some Dota 2 fan boy group that hate League for being the most popular PC game in the world.

-------------------

I just played a long, tough, hard fought game and got a very satisfying win. There is no evidence of that game existing anywhere. no match history, or even lp that would have put me into my promotional matches to go to gold 2. riot plz

-------------------

there is no "loss forgiven" this time watch closely, you still get your defeat every time (the number goes up) that "loss prevented" is just for your satisfaction  rito please, don't lie

-------------------

CALLED IT.  1:00am eastern (one hour ahead of their normal time), league gets DDOSed.  Get your **** together Riot.  They are literally DDOSing at the same time of day every day.

-------------------

I have been stuck on the "You have left a game in progress" screen for hours. Please at least take NA offline if you can't fix the problem immediately. I sympathize with not being able to permanently solve this issue, but there hasn't been any update on the LoL status on twitter or anywhere to warn summoners that things are wonky right now. Please Please Please get on it

-------------------

DDosed since season 2 op

-------------------

i normally don't complain but if there isn't some sort of compensation for all this I'll be (I think pretty understandably) disappointed in riot.

-------------------

You guys get mad, @LizardSquad gets glad.  Just ignore these dip****s. Seems a waste they got all this talent and use it to troll.

I'd suggest instead of fighting those people, offer them jobs. Obviously they know something you guys are missing.

Thank you Riot. Favorite maker of any online game, seeing as you're the only guys who have a game that kept my attention for longer than 2-3 months. Do your best, and the best of us will stay faithful always. Keep up the good work, Riot. *tearing up from motivational speech*

soo uhmmm if everything is fixed.. why the HELL are ranked ques still disabled?! that's the ONLY reason i play so late is so i can play ranked!! TURN THEM BACK ON!

What I'm saying is that the affected amazonaws servers you allow through your FW are the ones causing the destruction going unchallenged because they are whitelisted. 

Lizardsquad's Ion cannon botnet derives from that exploit, you need to start blacklisting internal traffic or move on to another provider, I have run TCP stream analysis with a network protocol analyzer and there are no signs of external IP's causing the overflow, it all comes from your own allowed servers, amazonaws shows, your ping server and 2 more IP's, everytime amazonaws pops on the stream when your ping server attempts to SYN, the game takes a dump.

Hey Everyone, 
Over the last couple of days, many of you have experienced some problems while playing the game. YouÂve seen reconnect spikes, issues with game starts, and very large login queue in many occasions. We wanted to take some time to give you all a little more information on whatÂs going on, since we havenÂt spoken much about this since the issues started occurring. 

In the last couple weeks our datacenter and game have been the target of some DDOS attacks. The results of these attacks have caused instability in our service. WeÂve been experiencing large attacks that have been filling up a significant chunk of bandwidth and causing parts of our system to lose connection to each other. The end result is a poor play experience for you all. While weÂve been able to turn on our loss forgiven feature as soon as the attack is detected, this does not equal a good play experience. 

While we canÂt share the details of the work we are doing internally to combat this (since it would give the attackers information to circumvent it), we want you to know that we are tackling this from many different angles. This includes working with our datacenter and internet service provider partners, as well as developing tools and services internally to make our service more robust against these types of attacks. Defending against DDOS attacks is an arms race that we will always be engaged in, and we are committed to reducing the pain you all feel as swiftly as possible when the service is being impacted by malicious attacks. 

We want you to know that this is the top priority for the Live Services team. We share your frustration at the impact of these attacks, and we are working to make sure you can play the game every time you want to. 

-Ryan 

Isnt this the same bs you told us a few months ago when the servers were getting DDOS'd everyday? This is inexcusable. Its been half a year and you've been making no progress, at all.

-------------------

For as much as I am glad to hear that something is being done about the matter, it doesn't change the fact that they should be stepping up their game. Riot is nearly a billion dollar company, and yet with all the resources available to them they still manage to be bested by petty hackers.

-------------------

Just wanted to say you guys are doing a terrible job with the Loss Prevention switches.  I've gotten Loss Prevented on more matches where everyone at the end was like "WTF?" because nobody was experiencing any issues than I've ever actually gotten on legitimately lagged out games.

-------------------

Thanks, it's been really frustrating.

East Coast or Central servers won't help this particular type of attack. These are pipefilling attacks that cut off the ability for services to talk to one another. The location of our servers has very little impact on the ability to execute that type of attack. 

I'm pretty sure the request for East/Central servers is so that we can actually have a 
reasonable ping during 
normal play. When I started playing League about 2 years ago, my ping rarely went over 80. Now, my ping is regularly at 100+, with frequent jumps to around 200 and sometimes higher, up to 4-500. 
This has persisted over three different ISPs and doesn't happen in any other game. This is very obviously a problem with 
Riot server latency and it 
greatly hinders how much I can enjoy the game. 

How can I possibly have fun when 
I have less control of my character than the opposing team 
due to latency? How can I not get frustrated when 
I can't help my team and 
repeatedly die during ping spikes? 

I want to enjoy playing League without having to fight the game itself.

-------------------

As with the post above I have huge complaints over latency issues. I am not saying East Coast servers would stop the DDOS problems, but a normal game for me should not become a competition of who has a better connection.  In addition I want to say I am unhappy about Riot handling DDOS. I have not had a loss forgiven in the past three days, and have dropped down because of it. All the games lost were because me or a member of my team could not play. In one game three different people on my team dced; the enemy team was perfectly fine. I just finished a game where I had 500 ping and dced twice. Before people start saying it's a problem on my end, I had 3 normal games before this that all went smoothly with no latency issues. I was home alone and the only one connected to my internet. The problem was on Riot's end, and like the rest of my games over the past three days, there was no loss forgivness.

-------------------

my internet has been working fine on all other games and on my web browser but for some reason i get on leauge and i keep getting disconnected from pvp.net and i cant join any queues or anything anyways i can fix this?

-------------------

Still not working and i played about 6 other games online but leauge pvp.net keep saying i have connection issues can some one plz help?....i want to play leauge    Thanks for reading.

Alright something that has come to my attention aswell and im pretty sure what the cause is. Back before the DDOS attack started i ran around 80 ping my self now i sit around 101-105+spikes I believe the cause is the security software they have been implementing to reduce the effects of the DDOS attacks. They say many times that YES there is technology that they COULD use to reduce the effectiveness of the attacks but it will also increase the latency across the board (wich is why i believe alot of us have gained around 20 latency it is the time it is taking the software to proccess and authenticate our data) any NOC Rioters want to confirm my suspicions here I would much appreciate it and believe the community would aswell.

-------------------

Is this still a thing? Please say it is cause my connection hast been terrible.

-------------------

fricken stupid attacks go the heck away and let me play the darn game!

-------------------

Andddddd thereeeeee baaaaaackkk. YAY!

-------------------

"Currently, games may not be starting. We are working to fix this  Let's be real. You have no defense. Why not just shut the whole thing down and fire it up later. I mean, that's what your player base is going to do. The ones that are still left. (checks Steam for a FTP RPG)

-------------------

I cant wait for the day that LOL servers will be more up than down..

-------------------

League of Lag  Only game with more down time than up time.

-------------------

Yay! First game in my promo series and no loss prevented even thou everyone including the other team complained about dc's and ping. I officially quit. You won't see another dollar from me. Dota seems much better. No bull****. You don't see blizzard getting shut down every day at the SAME TIME?

-------------------

Fix yourself before you rek yoself gurlxoxo,3101d4aad1364f35 <3

-------------------

Its been five days in a role, same period of time of the day which your servers have been taken down by these people, they are truly truly ruining game experience, riot, come on, are u seriously going to surrender to them and let them do it every single day? This is outrageous.

-------------------

Atleast back in the day they would try n compensate the loyal players who have stuck with em through all this bullcrap . some of us only have so much time to play and at certain hours only . Mine jss so happens to be when the servers mess up EVERY DAY !!

-------------------

How did this happen AGAIN, in the EXACT same time frame as yesterday? man.

-------------------

Riot, go f♪ck youselves, with a cactus, repeatedly, i hope every one in your company gets AIDS. damn useless slÂ¬lts.

-------------------

Yes, please loss prevention/forgiven the past 2 hours of games. My team experienced a lag spike in my placement match and the game was impossible to play through -_- I was at gold V mmr and we lost x.x

-------------------

https://twitter.com/LizardSquad/ These people are claiming to be the cause of these DDOS attacks I don't know if this helps any but Thumbs up this so they can see this

-------------------

All these people who act like fixing a DDos problem is a simple task... Its a free game, you guys aren't forced to pay them, and yet everyone expects so much...

-------------------

Just lost my promos because I "dodged" in champ select due to the DDOS (I was the team captain).  At least put me in my promos back?

Hey mate, play during the afternoons. You should be able to get a few games. I notice the attacks happen a little around 9pm CST. I played between 5pm and 7pm or 8pm CST and no problem. Anyways, I am sorry friend.

Wasn't it derptrolling a while back ddos'ing as a form of protest towards Riot taking so much money and not using it to improve servers? Maybe if the pockets would stop being lined and US East would get a server to benefit the players as Riot claims they want to do then attacks would stop... I mean good god Latin America's server is in MIAMI wtf is up with that.

Riot Games doesn't give into terrorism...or anyone's opinions to that extent as well.

-------------------

so can i get "leaving games" forgiveness, i am sick of these hour bans, i dont even get the que prompt and suddenly i am blocked for an hour. come on guys.

-------------------

No red post about how you guys WON tonight?  You defeated the Lizard Squad. Good job Riot.

-------------------

I cant seem to log in for the past 10 hours... It just says "loggin on" for a few seconds and all I get is a connection error. This is happening to all the players in Korea trying to connect to the NA server. Please address this issue Riot, Thank you.

-------------------

If it makes anyone feel any better, I can't log in either, but apparently it is because I've been banned for 14 days. If I get to log on before any of you do, the complaints I suspect will be quite interesting.  Just kidding, I'm not going to continue playing unless I get an apology for being wronged.

-------------------

sht i've try to login......

-------------------

Hey Riot, I'm personally tired of you guys saying "we're working on it, but we can't release the details of what we're doing".  Are you guys even really working on anything? This is ridiculous. With the amount of money you guys make off of this game, you should be able to at least have more stable servers. I love this game, but it's just disappointment after disappointment.

-------------------

But what about East Coast Ping?

-------------------

Couple of games recently I had lag spikes go up to 3,000 and wouldnt stay anywhere near 90 pings like it used to, GG Riot.

-------------------

Glad I lost my promos because the servers dropped. LCS > everybody else. Riot can't even keep their servers up but i'll be damned if the LCS doesn't keep going.

-------------------

i am tired of having random dc's and not being able to login afterwards in a ranked game. The login screen is still going for me saying "logging on" but has been like that for 20 minutes now so something is wrong with reconnecting and its costing me points in ranked so plz just disable ranked while u fix it or something else

-------------------

Wtf again with the server issues....... Booted after a win in ranked, and now unable to log on.

-------------------

I demand 400 rp

-------------------

If these types of people can use VPNs and mirrors and **** to not be detected and hide themselves why the **** can't you guys do something similar?

-------------------

I hope they DDOS the hell out of you until you actually realize that you need to have better servers. Your servers are a joke. High ping, lag, able to be drop hacked, and inability to log on.  You cant blame this on the ISP's or Firewalls any longer. It's 100% your fault you can't even run your own game.

-------------------

3 patches ago RIOT has been messing up are promos and games with a really not stable NA server with all the money they make even Dota2 with less profit has more stable servers so i am wondering how many players here spend money on skins for RIOT not to have at least server stable for more then a month

The LCS is on a different server. Often times even a different patch wall gardened off locally to prevent these kinds of things... The problem is that you cannot do this for internet based games like League so your ire is misplaced. 

While it's true that even Riot admitted that there are additional measures they /can/ take it comes at a cost. By making these changes the latency may increase as it has over time more and more. I started playing the game at 50ping on the east coast and now I'm lucky to get 130. 

People doing this because 'they can' or because 'companies aren't protecting you' is actually a form of extortion. While they may not directly benefit who is to say that security companies and code writers are not benefiting from this kind of attack? Many hackers often get hired by big security firms to help test and improve networks because they are able to do what they do. Either way it's illegal and should stop. The people doing this are criminals pure and simple. Their raison d'etre is simply to cause chaos because it gives them joy. The reason they give as why they do it is just a mask of nobility to protect their fragile egos.

-------------------

See this is why lytes ban system is bad, you ban the wrong kinda people (for really bullcrap things; and in some cases for things that would hardly count as an insult) and this starts happening.  STOP PISSING OF THE HACKERS. <------ Anyone with any common sense knows NOT to piss of hackers.   **** i bet there are those that haven't been banned that are doing this as well in rebelion of this communistic lyte ban system that is obviously automated; all cases are personally checked by a RL person my ass.  Your move RIOT.

-------------------

I want to know, does this include the 'firewall error' I have been having for two weeks? I've contacted player support but the tech team(probably busy) haven't been responding.

-------------------

What a crock of **** with riots excuses. There are plenty of other companies that don't have this problem like xbox, steam, valve, etc.. They are just being cheap, and could care less about the community. It's all about the money, think about it! They didn't make this game to make people happy, they made it to get rich! There greed will be their down fall. They got way to big, way to fast, and can't keep up with the demands of a game that has become so popular. I work at Xbox's labs in Redmond, if this were ever to happen to us at work, everyone one of us would get a very bad review. This would lead to the loss of our jobs, but then again Microsoft will throw money at the problem to fix it. Riot will not spend any money, instead they are cheap looking for their so called professionals handouts to fix the problem. Hell I bet all their servers have only 1 gig connections lol.

-------------------

my game is failing right now as we speak even tho you claim the servers are online.... i cant see anything im frozen up and restarting and reconnecting isnt doing anything. personally im bout fed up with this **** and getting no compensation from riot.... ip boosts, rp, anything!!!!! and dont act like you cant do it cuz i have recieved free rp because of server problems in the past.....but thats ok riot... just keep putting out new champions instead of fixing your issues.... heres an idea HIRE HACKERS TO COMBAT HACKERS, YOU OBVIOUSLY DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!!!

-------------------

I BlOODY CANT ****ING REFRESH ONE PAGE ON THE FORUMS WITHOUT GETTING A FLIPPING ERROR 500 PAGE UP, **** YOU AND YOU SAYING YOU ARE TRYING YOUR VERY BEST TO MITIGATE THESE DDOS ATTACKS, I NEVER HAD PLAYED SUCH A HORRIBLY REGULATED GAME IN AGES SUCH AS THIS ONE, I GET MORE SERVICE AND QUALITY FROM PLAYING ON MY GAME CUBE ONLINE GAMES, FFS YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO GET BANKRUPT VERY SOON AND I DOUBT YOU WOULD CARE SINCE YOU MADE MILLIONS OFF US ANYWAYS.

Oya you sure do share the frustration. So much in fact you take our money, obviously can't even get decent programmers, security, much less can't even barely have a forum to help anyone at all other than yourself. Have spent hundreds of dollars on this game thinking you would somehow be a fair company. You have massive problems, attacks, knowing your servers barely work, yet still i just got banned for your system that is flawed and screwing me over. Yet since you have some stupid ass tribunal program that doesn't care(much like you) as to what the basis was before giving a penalty or ban. If you cared about *the players* like you say stop bending us over and taking a home run. Then say "o man i know it's frustrating that we take your money but that doesn't mean we will have a tech support other than automatic responses because were stuck in 1995. Hell you don't even have a support number where you can actually talk to a person rather than having 0 help. You say the last 24 hours the attacks started then why has the last 2 weeks been having this same exact problem? Hmm? Maybe you can't admit that anything is ever your fault because then you might actually have to do some work and use some money to better you franchise. But hey "**** the players"? Not like your problems losing me all my rank back down to ****ing bronze now i am banned because of you **** servers, programmers, and ability to see that you are punishing players for your constant **** ups. Truly thinking about going to small claims court for my money back i wasted supporting you and stopping playing this game since the players you love o so much and care about are more likely to catch a meteor to the nuts than get any real help or understanding from you. So i speak proudly when i say **** you, i hope your lying asses choke on my stolen money and time.

Still impossible to login right now.

I finished a game, exited the game and then tried to start a new game join a team. Well it gave me the error that the server detects I am already in a game ad to restart the client. I restated the client and it tells me the game has crashed click to rejoin a game which I never started and then says my firewall may be blocking the program which is impossible cause I set all "three" firewalls to allow LoL through and then I even aloud my anti virus to allow LoL through...So why am I still getting an error for that if I allow them all through?

-------------------

Look guys, I don't like the down-time with the servers as much as you do but remember that this is a "Free-to-Play" game. They don't charge for service and we just pay for skins once and for new champs ONCE (unless you use IP then nothing at all). I'm not saying they can't do better, what I'm saying is that I think they don't have access to resources that multi-billion corporations do such as Microsoft and Sony, who by the way charge you more for their content and services.  Second of all, I'm sure these attacks are real. It has happened to people before. The Pentagon got hacked several times before and even NASA, Universities too. These punks go around F'ing up our day just like the trolls we experience in game but on a more damaging scale. We need to weed out, find, and put away these little punks so that we can finally game in peace. If you know a hacker, give them up to the authorities! Odds are they are not doing anything honorable with their knowledge when they could be helping prevent such heinous breaches of security and to our gaming time.  To Riot: If you do believe you need help with this or could use it, why not ask your customers? Create a donation fund for your community in an attempt to raise money that will solely go into cyber security and finally get ahead in this cyber arms race. Perhaps reach out for players who have cyber security experience and see if they could donate some time to help? Remember guys, Riot wouldn't be here without us and they need us to keep League in tip top shape.  We all need to pool together to protect our great League of Legends community. I love this game. I love a lot of the people I play with but if we want something done then lets not just place blame but try to assist the providers of the joy we hold dear. I want to play without trolls, hackers, and with the best servers accessible. Don't you too?

-------------------

oh and everyone complaining. when i first started playing i was able to get 20 games in with no problems, then i was dc one time and got a temp ban. this was late last year btw. What LoL had to tell me was that it must be my firewall and all this other bs. well got my step dad (a computer programmer) to figure out why i could not get on and the only thing i could do to play was completely stop using my firewall because they kept changing ports and all this other ****. League apparently has a bunch of newbs running it and are not here to tell you exactly what is happening so you will hopefully purchase some of their ****. Yeah it sucks you are under attack, but in my years of gaming blizzard got things fixed ASAP. SC had few issues, but they happened. D2 had issues, but as in SC they got fixed quickly and you really didnt have much issues. well i guess i was spoiled by blizzard though cause they would reset my characters for me when something like this **** happened.

-------------------

now this is sad, cant even go through the thread more cause the site is having issues. Its like they just decided to make a game and thought the gamers wouldnt try to kill them or something.

-------------------

here are some examples of what we gamers do. would think these guys would be smart enough to figure out how to beat themselves before others did.  http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-7-biggest-dick-moves-in-history-online-gaming_p2/ http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-7-biggest-dick-moves-in-history-online-gaming_p3/ http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-7-biggest-dick-moves-in-history-online-gaming_p5/ <-that one is the best example

-------------------

Imagine these attackers trying to DDoS an ISP like Verizon or Comcast. Imagine the retribution that goes along with it. Just give it time. They will stop soon enough, or like a fingerprint, they will be found.

-------------------

When was the last time this kind of attack was carried out on Xbox Live even once, let alone this consistently for this amount of time? Riot, you have to understand that server problems this CONSTANT is just plain not acceptable, no matter the excuse. You need to dust off the wallets, open them up, and spend the money on better servers. I'm sorry, you just need to. This instability **** is just going to keep continuing. Stop trying to put it off. I know nobody likes spending big money on stuff, but you no longer have a choice.

-------------------

Riot, its been five hours since Lizard Squad started DDOSing you guys, I fold.

-------------------

so far, i kept getting disconnected, but after a few minutes it goes away, seems like riot has improved its security, at least for me...

-------------------

Indeed, riot, you need to spend some money and upgrade your security as well as the servers or keep getting attacked over and over. Your choice.

-------------------

Ya Riot please fix the servers my game ended 30 mins ago and it still says i'm in it

-------------------

Riot should put out a bounty on these attackers! I bet all our computer savvy players would love the extra cash to hunt these guys down.

-------------------

Check out my song "SERVER LAG" - parody of Super Bass by Nicki Minaj :P  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OZ5rhofFmg

-------------------

Just shut your network of servers down for good. Start over, with better equipment and better anti-DDOS protection. You'll never outsmart these attackers because they'll always find away to exploit your network security.  I can wait 5 years to play League again if it means I can play lag free.

-------------------

I have a question about Loss Forgiven, hopefully a Rioter can answer this for me (or anyone else who is certain on the answer).  So, as most of us ranked players know, upon being promoted to a new tier/division you have a 'safety net' of a few games where you cannot be demoted at 0 LP. I am wondering if Loss Prevented games count towards these "safety net" games. I'm aware that they don't count as a loss, but do they still count as a game played?

-------------------

So let me get this right, you have DECAY on while we have to wait for you to figure out a DDOS attack? this is not acceptable you need to turn DECAY OFF while you fix a problem...PLEASE explain how and why you would allow DECAY to stay on while your servers are nonstop loss forgiven 5lp given.... PLZ STOP THE DECAY WHILE WE WAIT!

-------------------

Compensation? The servers have been so bad for weeks now...

-------------------

EDIT: Uninstalling/Re-installing overnight seems to have fixed things. I will leave the original message below for others having this issue.   My game was fine earlier tonight, but about an hour ago I tried to play a custom game with friends. I picked a champion, then could not connect to the actual game. I keep getting stuck there, unable to connect to a game. Tried it in 2 games with them which ended up turning our custom 3v3 into a 2v3.   Repaired the game then decided to try again. I tried to do a custom game, but I couldn't even make one. Got a message like "Due to a high number of games, you cannot make a new one now" or something. That made sense considering how bad the servers are right now, but I still wanted to see if repairing the game had fixed things. I didn't want to put more people into a 2v3 or a 4v5 and my friends had started a new game while I repaired, so I started a Co-Op vs AI game. I felt bad about possibly putting others into a 4v5, but it was Beginner Bots, so I didn't feel too guilty. We all got stuck in champ select, but things seemed to be going okay. Then I got the same Error.   These are the messages I'm getting.   1055126  1055125   I don't really want to mess around with my firewall, especially since things worked fine earlier tonight. Apart from that, does anyone else know a way to fix this?

-------------------

When a company such as Riot get DDOSed, the attack is very rarely done by a single person. Most people do not have the resources to produce enough data packets to affect servers like the ones used for league. The problem with "fixing" the issue Riot is currently faced with is that most decent hackers can cover their tracks making it difficult to determine the source of the data packets and in order to hit the large servers Riot use there are going to be large number of attackers.  The only way to fix the current server issues would be to find and take the attackers out of the picture through the slow and annoying American legal system or to buy servers with better protection. Riot will not buy new servers, but they will sue the individuals responsible for all the profits they are gonna lose.  No matter how stupidly expensive League of Legends can be we have to realize it is a free to play game and Riot will lose less money keeping the servers up until they deal with the servers than they would buying new servers.  Hackers hack for two main reasons: money and if something is personal. League has pissed off a load of eight year olds, but realistically it's more likely that some one is getting paid. Give it two weeks the problems should be sorted out, and Riot will come out like the big hero but most likely the hackers will have finished their contract and move on to some other project.  Long story short be patient the servers will go back to being meh soon enough. You probably shouldn't play ranked until it is so if you're not happy with your position play in the morning servers seem to work best around noon.

-------------------



-------------------

The sad reality is this. I estimate roughly %5 to %9 of the player base has moved on to other games because of this. I haven't played the game in two days because of other games and when I finally decided to try and play some League tonight, I couldn't log on. Compounding my frustration and disbelief from 3 days ago when I was still playing daily.   I believe the exact words that came out of my mouth were "This is pathetic."   So the excuses don't matter. I've already gotten interested in other games and my interest in League has diminished greatly because of it. Sorry Riot, but you shouldn't be dragging your asses. Take out a loan, buy some new servers.   If I try to log on again and it doesn't work, I'm probably done. This has gone on long enough.

-------------------

Your message for ranked being disabled dissappeared so me and my friend tried to duo. and i never even got in a que or anything but somehow i got counted for a que dodge and lost lp in everything, but i was never even in a champion select... awesome.

-------------------

so tired of getting 1800 ms in games, starting the game when it says "loss prevented has been turned on" and then all of a sudden i end the game and its been turned off and i get a loss... can you not just keep it on for 30 freaking minutes..

-------------------

I just don't understand why you don't simply throw some money at people who are good at handling cyber attacks, Riot. Your servers are basically being molested by a bunch of 15 year olds with too much time on their hands. You're probably thinking "Oh it'll stop once their school starts and they have homework again," and you're probably right, but that's no way to run a company.  You can't deny that you're dick-deep in money. You pumped out like 7 different skins in the last month or so. Maybe focus a little more on the infrastructure of the game, rather than all the embroidery?

-------------------

Good luck, Riot. You need it I guess. DDOSers are merciless after all!

"But muh E$ports".

-------------------

Just an idea for some devs. Have an app wrapped around your login portal. Try to handle logins through this app, basically, the idea is to use a boolean operator to switch a dos off your portal. Once you do that, you can send the high volume attacks to a VM where a database just picking up ip addresses. Once you have the ips, you can just hard code block them via that table with the ips. So, if someone is attacking your server, you can just route them out. If you're running the website off the same server, I would go ahead and invest in a single server. Only problem would be a large queue could possibly fire off that same trigger. I'm not sure what angle they are hitting you from, but just an idea for you guys. Anyway, just a thought, I'm sure you all have it already handled though. I'm sorry about the attacks. It's a pain to deal with when your servers are constantly getting hit. Best of luck

-------------------

A possible suggestion; would it be possible to allow players to support the game they are currently in case of unforeseen server problems. That way it might lighten the load of the game servers and players can possibly have a better experience in the event the servers fail the game for some reason. Or would this allow players to be attacked themselves? I'm not much of a programmer so I wouldn't know how this suggested system would work.

-------------------

Could we make our ping more visible outside the game so when we notice spikes we can avoid jumping in a game all together? Often times when an attack or other network issue is happening it isn't apparent to those already logged in so we don't see there is a problem until we are staring at 400ms ping in the summoner loading screen. Just an idea!

Last game, I was shown as 100% connected in the loading screen. It stalled as it pretty much always does nowadays so I reconnected. When I reconnected, two of my teammates and myself had apparently had the same problem for about ten minutes into the game. At this point the other team was about 8-10 levels ahead of us. At this point, we realized that the game was effectively lost but we attempted to play through it hoping for a loss prevented. As per usual with League of Legends, you will not get what you expect and we were handed down the merciless sign of 'Defeat'. I understand the scenario of the DDOS attacks, however if this is the case why does Riot toggle between loss prevented and defeat? Knowing there is instability in the server and knowing that there have been serious connection issues for the past several WEEKS(not days), it seems to make sense to either shut down the system and figure out the issues or to give loss prevented until the issues are resolved.   TL;DR: Connection issues have caused people like me losses that were completely unfair and loss prevented needs to be put on until all issues have had actual solutions and not temporary fixes.

-------------------

Unacceptable for a company with this much profit not to have DDoS protection that is top of the line.

-------------------

25 hours and still recovering? Only PSN had it worse but that was several years ago when technology wasn't as great at protecting from these attacks, this is unacceptable, everyone is still joking for Lizard Squad to try to DDOS Microsoft and DOTA 2 but everyone knows they are too afraid of that.

I couldn't even connect to my game today and now I have a leave. Thanks riot.

-------------------

No offense but rather than hear how your trying to combat it I just want to know that Riot, Blizzard and Sony have reported this to the FBI. From what I have heard and understand it simply can't be stopped unless the person who is doing it is arrested and taken down.

A possible suggestion; would it be possible to allow players to support the game they are currently in case of unforeseen server problems. That way it might lighten the load of the game servers and players can possibly have a better experience in the event the servers fail the game for some reason. Or would this allow players to be attacked themselves? I'm not much of a programmer so I wouldn't know how this suggested system would work. 

Bad idea. Like... a really bad idea.

Ok, so its going to be 2 days now?

Apparently going to be two days of this ****, come on riot! I know this is not your fault but hot damn give us some kind of assurance or feedback or timescale! Its like the company is run by a fair amount of mimes or monks sworn to silence. I do not mean to be rude but its kinda lame that it has been 48 hours almost :/

A small fraction of it is not their fault for being DDOS Attacked, a major portion of it is their fault for having such paper servers.

One large problem we've seen is once we turn on mitigation, latency increases by a large amount. With this latency increase you have essentially taken down the service yourself. 

If a rioter had to play with a ping not from the west coast, we'd already have centrally located servers and wouldn't ALREADY be dealing with high ping regardless of DDoS attacks. On GOOD days I see 86 ping. On normal days it goes from 90-100+ and during attacks the game is unplayable. Meanwhile, your game doesn't discern that I can't actually do anything in the game as I'm floating in limbo between connected and unconnected so my character stands there and gets "#rekt" and my team *****es at me. 

Do something other than give political non-answers like you guys have gotten so good at.

-------------------

LizardSquad made CNN news for sending a bomb threat to the president of Sony while he was mid-air. They forced the plane to land at the closest airport. If a bomb threat against a plane in this day and age doesn't get the FBI on this immediately, people mad about playing games won't. Riot, Blizzard and Sony have minimal control over this. Now that this has become National news (for the bomb threat) I'm getting some popcorn to watch this unfold. This guy is toast in his moms basement.

-------------------

Do these attacks also have anything to do with the spectating problems? I haven't been able to spectate a game for more than five minutes for days, getting notifications such as "unable to retrieve spectator data" and "game ended without a result and will now exit." It's pretty frustrating having to reconnect every few minutes.

Not sure if you guys have heard of WTFast, but I downloaded it a few weeks ago, and it's REALLY helping. This is going to sound like an advert for them, I know, but as someone on the East Coast that used to play with 115-130 ping on average, the 86-90 that I'm getting now is fantastic.   I hated the idea that I would have to access a third-party network in order to play this game, but I figured I'd try it for a week and would cancel if it didn't work. It affects a lot of the other games I play, so I don't mind paying a little for it, but League is the only game that absolutely requires it in order for me to have a fair playing field with my opponents.   As proof of how much it helps, here is a screenshot I got of my connection over a period of about 2.5 hours earlier tonight.   1055751 The most shocking part of it is the fact that with my normal connection, I'd have a Packet Loss count of 483. That is insane, and no other game affects me that badly. I know that Riot's server is getting attacked right now, and I don't blame them for that, but even under normal circumstances, their NA server is not great. I'm putting this info here so that more people can be helped by it.

Please tell me you're not so geographically ignorant that you think that North America is anywhere near as small as 5 countries that connect to the EUW server. 

The complete EU size: 1,691,658 sq mi 

North America's size: 9,540,000 sq mi 

Tell me we deserve 1 server for our entire continent when they get 2 for being nearly a 1/9th smaller.

Here's the population for the EU: 507.4 million people 
Here's the population for NA: 528.7 million (as of 2008) 

I imagine we have far more people playing on our servers than they do on theirs and they get 
TWO servers to split the load across their country. Oh wait, that's right. We get LAN where I can't even speak the language or read it to be able to make an account so I can play with a decent ping with people I won't be able to communicate with. Silly me.

Hey Everyone, 
Over the last couple of days, many of you have experienced some problems while playing the game. YouÂve seen reconnect spikes, issues with game starts, and very large login queue in many occasions. We wanted to take some time to give you all a little more information on whatÂs going on, since we havenÂt spoken much about this since the issues started occurring. 

In the last couple weeks our datacenter and game have been the target of some DDOS attacks. The results of these attacks have caused instability in our service. WeÂve been experiencing large attacks that have been filling up a significant chunk of bandwidth and causing parts of our system to lose connection to each other. The end result is a poor play experience for you all. While weÂve been able to turn on our loss forgiven feature as soon as the attack is detected, this does not equal a good play experience. 

While we canÂt share the details of the work we are doing internally to combat this (since it would give the attackers information to circumvent it), we want you to know that we are tackling this from many different angles. This includes working with our datacenter and internet service provider partners, as well as developing tools and services internally to make our service more robust against these types of attacks. Defending against DDOS attacks is an arms race that we will always be engaged in, and we are committed to reducing the pain you all feel as swiftly as possible when the service is being impacted by malicious attacks. 

We want you to know that this is the top priority for the Live Services team. We share your frustration at the impact of these attacks, and we are working to make sure you can play the game every time you want to. 

-Ryan 

good, you guys are the largest MOBA in the world right now you should be prepared and expect this **** to happen at least now you are ready for the next one...

-------------------

i think you guys need to get the power-hungry ****s outta the tribunal, i just got a 34 game chat restriction for no reason at all, i literally haven't typed a thing for the past week and a half. This isn't the first time something like this has happened either when i haven't said a thing. HOW ABOUT COMING UP WITH A MORE EFFICIENT PUNISHMENT THAN CHAT RESTRICTION. I play games where smart pinging people isn't enough, and no one knows what to do or asks what to do. CHAT BAN DOES'T JUST EFFECT YOU, IT EFFECTS THE ENTIRE TEAM.

Wow, I shut down every application, even closed all web browsers on my computer, and last game I couldn't even see what was happening in team fights as the pings would spike to 3,000 and rubber band so hard that my commands wouldn't even register, this game is ****

-------------------

Rito PLZ... Days ?! Wrong word... Months is the right one....  So far, you have the worst Server i've ever played on, and i have played alot of online games.

-------------------

Had a game where everyone had 3000~ ping. I didn't finally reconnect till 17 minutes in and it had been a 3 v 5 for a decent amount of time, the last person on our team didn't reconnect for another 3~ minutes. I understand it happens but the loss wasn't prevented, I'd appreciate if it was.

-------------------

I never get on the forums to complain; as in this is my first post ever... but this server instability is completely unacceptable. What made it worse is when I see a post blaming it on some DDOS attacks over the past few DAYS? Ok so that explains the last few days of bad server issues, but what about the last couple of MONTHS? There hasn't been a week that has gone by when I think to myself "Wow this feels great; no lag, no attempting to reconnect, no teammate or enemy getting disconnected for the entire game wasting 40 minutes of my time, etc." To top it all off Riot still has 1 data-center for the entire US? Oh wait never mind, I forgot about the Miami server that supplies LATIN AMERICA....  But here I am, ranting before I log on to play a few laggy games(knowingly) before bed. Just call me the Devil's advocate. There is no progress with complacency.

Months? Try 5 years, people have been complaining about the latency and lag spikes since Beta, there still is a thread from 3 days after the game was launched in Beta asking for East Coast Servers.

Champion development teams have nothing to do with servers or security. And "paying them more" isn't going to help the issue, either. 

So, saying "Stop making content, fixes the servers" doesn't really work. The only department that actually 
does take away from live server teams, is eSports. Dead serious. Being that the eSports department has its own server repair team.

happened to me today and I solved it. 

go to the league folder (usually C:/Riot Games/League of Legends) 

go to the RADS folder then PROJECTS, then delete the folders "lol_launcher" and "lol_patcher"... after that, run League of legends (pref as an administrator) 

the game should atomatically refresh those folders and fix the launcher problem. (the patcher should downlad again, but then I had to fo a Repair from the Launcher main page -top right cog icon-) 

hope it helps.

Well, all we can do now is have faith in Rito and hope that they find a solution soon. Otherwise, looks like we will be the next EU WEST. Good luck with all your login endeavors and Riot good luck solving the issue. Hopefully that happens within 3 days so I can play a ranked game to not decay. :C

-------------------

Thank you for finally coming out and making an actual response rather than saying that you are working on fixing what is wrong. Shouldn't keep your players in the dark for this long. As a developer, I understand the battle and struggle it takes to defend against these attacks. I hope everything works out soon.

-------------------

So, is the NA servers down because im sitting here 1st in queue with 1 seconds left but not getting in.

-------------------

To all of you who keep talking bad about Riot, you have absolutely NO idea the struggle and amount of work it takes to defend against DDOS attacks. Educate yourselves before you comment.

-------------------

Luckily the World Championship is not held in the USA this year, otherwise people around the world will laugh at what we call Riot the father of LOL and American networking technology.

-------------------

Why can't you just make it so only people from North America can play in North America. I mean it only makes sense right. Block anybody else trying to access NA from a foreign country because that is where all the ddosing is happening right? i'm sure every single NA player would be pleased as well to not have spanish/ korean/ chinese speaking people in their games not saying anything in english

Good thing the other companies victim to lizard squad ddos haven't already fixed the issue by spending some of the large waves of money they take in. Oh..hmm they did that. Well then. rito anytime...

You know, people QQ so hard about things that cant be helped but never really take the time to thank them for the hard work that they do to keep this game going. Yes there are balance issues, yes there are things that could be done better, but four or five years for a company is not all that long. TBH hating on them is not going to help anything. I don't know a lot about networking and stuff but i think everyone has a miss conception that stopping a DDOS attack is as easy a flipping a switch. the only thing that we can do is chill and wait. Thank you riot for your hard work.

Na IS DOWN I REPEAT NA IS DOWN XD

I really wanted to play before I left for work.

I blame the attack on the Native Americans... they've been planning for centuries ...

so i still have that problem ~ just let me wait about 20mins and when time was out the screen just stay on 1sec and its all ??

Rito should really get some help from blizzard tho just saying cause..... blizzard gets hacked but thier defense its so good that the hackers never escape and blizzard has thier own set of hackers, therefore blizzard only gets hacked once in a blue moon and if u are wondering who blizzard is they are the people that run World Of Warcraft #TrueStory

Lol ur retarded. You think a group of teenagers DDOSing large internet companies while being sought after by the FBI and haven't been raided yet are from the US? That's cute.

Hah. Hahah. So true, but at least they said more than "We are aware of issues logging in and are working to resolve it."

-------------------

I don't get it. You dont gain anything for DDOSing a server. Some people are just a massive pain in the ass.

-------------------

Im ready to jump ship on LoL and start playing another MOBA due to Riot being unable to keep their servers up for what the last 6 months, this has just gotten ridiculous. Anyone play other MOBA's that are not having this problem?   Maybe Ill just go back to HoN

I think it's certainly possible. 

At the very least, the Lizard Squad website was located in the US, since the FBI managed to take it down.

-------------------

I somehow managed to log in but no one is on =[

-------------------

you can only apologize so much and keeping screwing your player base before they lose all respect for the game you guys created you lost sight of what it meant when you first started this, now the ones who have lost respect are probably ****ing your servers, maybe focus on the real issues of your ranked play system and how you punish people, instead of what new skin ward skin or rune page bundle or champion deal you can offer constantly, you became all about profit its sad............ start working hard for your players again and not for the sole purpose of what you can get out of them for it. but because you want them to enjoy the game that got riot to where you are now. like it was in season one.

-------------------

I'm really chubby and i just want to play league all day haha... Thank you for making the effort to fix these constant problems

-------------------

I work an 8 to 6 job, married, kid on the way, and I have to say, the server issues every. single. night. is making me regret starting LOL back up again. I got hooked and I need my fix.   I appreciate the updates on the server status page, and I really hope the Riot legal team is getting ready to make an example out of some ScriptKiddies.

-------------------

Dear Riot VideoGames.com,  The choice is your's and your's to make. For every minute that League Legends is down I will bowl a smoke of pot. I'm 30 minminutes in and think I'm going to die. You did this.  With Love... and Pot 879574b28e6c8987

-------------------

no compensation, typical gluttons.

-------------------

Its not comeing back from what I have seen on twitter LizardSquad is good at keeping things shut down soo goodluck.

-------------------

trash server trash game not surprised

-------------------

Ok, ive been hitting a high amount of ping...high being 17,000+ ping. I have nothing downloading, nobody using my wifi. It happens at the most random of moments, and its just being a buzzkill when im in a team fight trying to play and i get a reconnecting notification. Can somebody please notify me whether im the only one getting this type of lag or not...and if a riot member could clarify whether this is from the DDOS issues you guys have been having or not

I'm married, kid in my belly (entering the final month of pregnancy), and I work a lousy dead-end job. League is probably one of the few things that keeps my emotional state of mind in check, and you know that **** is off the charts atm with these hormone spikes. When I see that the game is down, I'm bummed out... so I feel your pain. AFK gotta run, distracting husband is distracting. asdfsadf

-------------------

What the **** are u doing get your **** under control loosers

-------------------

I finally decided to spend more money on the game now that I thought the DDoS attacks where over. Guess that was another poor decision that I definitely won't make again.

-------------------

position in q 1 wait 52 mins, now 12 mins, 1 sec, oh wait 52 mins

-------------------

I'm confused. Someone (or a group) is making deliberate attacks on this game, but a lot of us are mad at Riot because.... reasons?

-------------------

how are all those people that wanna get gold going to play if this game is always down....something new every night....

-------------------

Please ritooo

If your security system fails to keep a thief out of your home, you get mad at both the thief and the **** security system. 

Don't get me wrong. Gecko Squad or whatever they're calling themselves can eat a bag of *****es, but Riot isn't innocent in this either. This went on for an entire week. One would think they would have formulated a defense by now. 

But I understand. Pushing out Arcade Veigar was extremely important.

-------------------

league of legends Riot tryndamere was drinking vodka and no longer cares about the game.

-------------------

DDOS was used in a movie called "Hackers" - it was made in 1995. Are you really that lame Riot?

-------------------

I spectated a game and left early, and it won't let me join another game saying I'm already in one that I left, but it was just as a spectater and the game's over anyways, but it won't let me play another game. Do you know about this and do you know the cause, and can you fix it?

-------------------

It's getting kind of frustrating. Especially after finishing a game and you CAN'T reconnect to even attempt to join another game. Lots of problems that are very disappointing because riot never use to be this unstable. To be honest, I am loosing a little faith in riot and really loosing interest in playing ranked/normal games because of all the constant problems.

-------------------

Make a VIP server that has state of the art defense against hackers and charge the users of said server a premium. Additionally make said server priority over everything else..... TAKE MY MONEY $$$$

This thread provided literally the same exact amount of "information" as all of their previous posts. They didn't address East Coast / Central servers, compensation, how long it's estimated to take for DDOS attacks to successfully be prevented, etc.. 

compensation for what? this game is Free To Play. You aren't losing any money.

$632 million in 2013 and we cant seem to give NA good connection with low ping. 

can we all just remember that North America has some of the slowest, and least maintained Internet infrastructures world wide? Also, some of the most expensive.

-------------------

im in qatar and before the update my ping is 300(normal ping in qatar) but now my ping is 1k and it wont go down. Riot please

-------------------

Riot you are such a ****ed up company i just play a rank game in na server all my teammates are disconnected and super laggy and you counted that game and didnt make it lost prevented.  I play world of warcraft 10 years ago and their server is 100 times more stable then yours.  You guys are hopeless

-------------------

Some will find a way to blame Riot for this, but they're handling it in a splendid manner. Best of luck to you.

-------------------

Seems like you could just sticky this forever and it would always be relevant

-------------------

id like to win one game today , but no DDOS attacks make that impossible. you have to pray that you dont get a lag spike in a match while in a team fight. btw did i mention that their team is 100% burst ? so the fact that their facerolling away while im almost lagged out of game makes it fun.  Azir is currently the ONLY reason why im still playing

-------------------

Annoymus vs Lizard Squad LETS GO TEAM MERICA VS ******s

-------------------

Every other game in ranked has a DC. Never get a Loss Prevented. How is ranked supposed to work if you lose every other game to a 4v5 or 3v5? Was this account selected to stay in one tier forever? Just curious, thanks. Going to play Smite now to calm down.

-------------------

Thanks for sharing the information on this

-------------------

East Coast Servers.

-------------------

The game kicks me 15 times out of games with reconnect or 20 seconds lag spikes. No loss forgiven.  Never EVER LAGGED ONCE in 2 years of dota.  NO LOSS FORGIVEN???

-------------------

Just installed random patch and then I lagg out of champ select in a ranked game..it freezes me in the lobby so I have to exit and lose LP and have to wait to Q up again....jeez. Cmon riot.

-------------------

Same as above. Champ select froze kicked everyone out and I took a loss in my 3 game of promos for it. Well played riot well played.

-------------------

And there goes yet another series because of lag that has been happening at random moment. Nobody downloading anything, nobody using my internet, just a random lag spike at the worst of times

-------------------

regarding instabilities, I have to ask, does anyone else have issues spectating games? Personnaly, it's been giving me an error message saying "unable to download spectator data" and shuts down my viewing =/

-------------------

Ive been having a problem where i cant connect to my chat services, meaning i cant message anyone or be invited to games, and its really annoying because i cant participate in the sugar rush at all for mystery gifts and i really wanted to try my luck. Ugh, its so frustrating. ;(

-------------------

I cant even play right now because every 30 seconds ping spikes to 2000. it was workin fine all week and now its being silly again

-------------------

I CANT EVEN LOG ON! After this happened i don't know if it's doing something to my internet, but my internet has become veeeeery slow. I'm really frustrated... but thank you for trying to fix it. hopefully soon. very. soon.

-------------------

honestly man, i have never gone below 80 ping in league of legends, rarely do i ever hit the low 90s when i play and i end up sitting at average 120 ping through my entire games, i know i need some technical help and i would appreciate some suggestions but if the NA server is having ping issues then i hope you realize that not only does that affect the overall experience a player has with your game but their actual ability to play your game all together, by that i mean that i cant carry even if i was fed 20/0 kayle full build against 5 bronze players, i honestly find this enfuriating as it is like having an automatic snare the entire gane, i have tried switching to wired internet connection to my modem but that just makes it get worse progressively, i can only play when i use the wifi, but then there is my internet connection which is ACN and holy **** do i regret switching to this, i need to know a good unlimited Internet provider and if any of you have suggestions i would appreciate it but again, i cant play league of legends to the best of my abilities because of ping, it is a chore to play and i am ashamed to admit that this constantly makes me explode in a fit of rage and doesnt help that the rest of my team in loew silver elo call me insulting names for my lament as i express how bull**** it all is, i want this to get fixed and if you can do something about it then that makes me happy but to be completely honest i truly think your banning system is broken as much as the low elo community's ability to work as a team.

-------------------

I have a problem since yesterday...I try to log in on NA i get connection error... but i can log in just fine on EUW - EUNE. I tried to repair patcher -> restarted router. still can't log in on NA.

-------------------

-.- seems like its always DDOS everytime.... gives a Huge hint to strengthen the Servers don't it if its constantly being attacked.

-------------------

stuck at attempting to reconnect in game...right as we were about to win too...

-------------------

So let me see if I got it right. This problem started over a week ago 
and you guys haven't solved it yet; however, you do have enough time, 
team and budget to keep doing chat restriction on players. Could you 
please tell to your customers a.k.a players how much are you really 
investing on your servers? a7f1e715c6602f62

-------------------

same i hate that so bad lol. now just hanging out waiting

-------------------

Yea i get the reconnect button... But it says failed attempt and something about my firewall and shows a retry button?

-------------------

this is ****ing bull**** fix the servers i dont pay for skins not to be able to use them u nerdy ****s

-------------------

This has been going on for months. I'm not trying to be a jerk but you guys better nip this in the bud soon. Lot's of competition is headed your way and they don't have half the problems these servers do. It's very frustrating to be playing a good game and something beyond my control ruins it. Get the federal law involved if someone is hacking your servers. That's a federal offense.

-------------------

Idiots

-------------------

My my ddos ruined my promos and my life XD

-------------------

just got stuck in champ select with game starting soon for 15 minutes before i quit and tried to log back in to get stuck with log in error server is busy messages, I have an IP boost active, i hope i get some of my lost time back for this.

EA, Sony, Blizzard, and every other major MMO company has had the same issue. Also the feds can only do so much, they do not have international jurisdiction.

I gotta go to work in the next hour... If i leave now will this go toward my leave count? Really don't want to, but the game is broken and i have other thing more important than waiting for it to be fixed to do...

-------------------

You should really think about compensating people for this, people spend a lot of money on this and no one is happy that this is constantly happening. Compensate people for the time and money they put into this game.... For real...

-------------------

I try to get on at least once a day for first win. But lately every time I log on it has the connection problem... Like right now i'm in an aram and we're all stuck reconnecting. I understand you guys are under attack but this is crazy. I mean this has been over 2 weeks of instability

-------------------

After the update legend is very bad game to play now. It is not because it is not a good game for majority players. It is because the company does not take the players serious. They just update whenever, they wanna to. No matter it is complete or not. As we known, none one can successfully play one game now. I was gonna play rank with my friends and we failed to login. Therefore, we decided that we gonna switch to the other games.

-------------------

Just now Took me 15 minutes to reconnect because the damn server kicked me out of active game and then kept me out saying cannot connect... this is ridiculous.....it should be this hard to Have a stable server with all the money this game is getting seriously. Really irritating

Exaclty how I feel about this. I don't even remember how much money I've spent on this game this year alone, only to time and time again arrive from work and realize that I can't even enjoy my purchase to its full extent due to constant server related issues! Please invest more time and effort into a stable playing environment! flashy skins and particles simply don't charm me enough to keep me craving to play... 

-A sad player of the Rift.

-------------------

all i see is complaints from us all but we keep playing anyways, this is what everyone on league should do. DO NOT BUY ANYMORE SKINS AND GIVE RIOT MONEY. THEY SHOULD BE PUTTING THAT MASS AMOUNT OF MONEY INTO SECURITY FOR THEIR SERVERS, BUT CHANCES ARE THEY JUST BOOST THEIR OWN SALARIES. ive given up buying skins in support for them since this server lag became way worse around june. if we all stop buying them they will need to make changes. they care much more about the lcs then the actually fanbase of the game. which will completely ruin them when heroes of the storm comes out.

-------------------

Maybe not money compensation but like 10000 IP or like a skin of our favorite champ not to exceed $5.. something to keep people happy.

-------------------

Some compensation would be nice lol

Yes, I'm having the same connection issues. 
Yes, I got kicked out of a game that I'm unable to reconnect to. 
Yes, the game is wonky right now. 
No, I'm not going rage against the developers, the server engineers, or anyone else and start to sling mud just because I cannot play 1 video game (of my 1,000's) on a Saturday. It's not sunny so I'm not going outside, but I'll just load up another game. However I had to post here to provide [reasonable] feedback that I am have these issues .

See i'm not looking for compensation. I'm just upset that during the IP boost weekend We cannot play. Yes i'm upset that my transaction took my money and didn't give me what i wanted but that will be fixed it usually is... but the game is meant to be enjoyed and all people do is whine about what they want and cannot have. I just want to play the game straight and simple. It is ridiculous that all people can think about is what is OWED to them on a FREE TO PLAY game. Nobody makes you buy the skins ward skins or champs YOU choose to do so. Not Riots fault that they are getting people trying to destroy the game. Look all i'm saying is be part of the solution and not help make it a worse problem by trying to MAKE them compensate you when you could just spend your time doing something else or something productive.

Exactly! You people chose to donate your money to the game. Riot has no obligation to make you happy. Because tomorrow when the game is fixed, i guarantee you will be back. And riot since then would not have lifted a finger. And the world keep spinning as nothing ever happened.

-------------------

to be honest I wish i could find the *******s doing these DDOS attacks and cut their ****ing hands off, I mean what kind person sits around all day in their mom's basement trying to **** a company when all their really doing is ****ing all the people trying to play the game, have riots profits gone down at all this year? No, so your ****ing vendetta against them has worked out SOOOOOOO well. I hope they get caught and when they do I plan to send them a gift to their prison cell, a nice bar of soap, coated in Teflon.

Ah see my friend this is where you are false. They do what they can. I get emails, updates and apologies. Which is more than i really EVER got with Blizzard. They are a free to play game but they try to reach out to their summoners here. I love this game and the Rioters that I have met and played with and cannot wait to meet and play with more of them. I just want to be able to play

-------------------

Months gone bye.. "working on it"

-------------------

Look we all are having issues, but bit*cing about it on here isn't going to help. I mean sure I have a 3 day boost ticking right now and just bought a butt load of skins, but I don't think riot owes me anything other then a speedy recovery brought on with the best of their abilities. I have a 3 minute wait time right now on my log-in and will soon be back in and playing. So everyone just chill and understand that sometimes things are out of your hands/Riots hands just like when you play a league game.

Ok well that's pretty general info. Of course they'll send you a toilet paper with the words written "We r sorry! Here let us wipe you ass for you!" Why? Because they want people to continue playing. But... They will never step out of their own ways to go to you and help you with your problem. Unless of course you problem has something to do with money.

But your negative attitude is probably what keeps this game from running happily. I see this as an opportunity to quit sitting still in front of a screen for a few minutes. Be happy you have a game to play not ***** and complain that they dont hand you what you want on a silver platter

Nobody is donating anything sir. If it wasn't a profitable thing, they'd 
be out by now. They are paying people to work and making money over our 
purchases. Last year, they made half billion in revenues. So, they DO have 
an obligation to satisfy their customers - our players - regardless of 
what you think. You're really naive if you think they care about you as a 
player and not see you as a potential buyer.a7f1e715c6602f62

-------------------

My only complaint, is that I don't play League very often. I'll get on for a few hours every so often to play this game. Luckily I haven't had a lot of issues with DC's, until today. The one day I decide to get a skin for a champion. I got to play a bot game just to have fun (that's all they are really for), and I get DC'd. Ok well whats my problem? Everyone's getting that? My Problem is the fact that Riot despite having all these issues, launches a brand new launcher. What does it do? absolutely nothing. All it is, is an additional screen and function we have just to get on the game. So if you want to play these days, you have to click the icon, click launch on the first launcher, then on the second launcher enter your information and click launch again, which now prompts you to wait about 5 minutes at times to be logged in because of the server issues, to finally get onto the game main screen. Instead of making a fancy new add-on screen like all other companies are doing that doesn't do anything, why not focus more effort to make the servers more stable? I don't care about the new champs or new skins but why make a whole added step to just trying to play a game when you know that people are already going through an added step that's caused by server issues?  Just a thought, next time you want to apply a new system that doesn't really enhance the experience...make sure that people can just enjoy the game unhindered. We won't notice it that much and you won't be the target of bad press. But that's none of my business *sips tea*

Nobody is donating anything sir. If it wasn't a profitable thing, 
they'd be out by now. They are paying people to work and making

you think they care about you as a player and not see you as a

I'm a madam tyvm. And I am not naive at all. I have spoken to several of 
the rioters and they do give a care. But all I am saying is YOU CHOOSE to 
pay for things that are of no influence to the game itself. The Game is 
FREE. And the money they get from the skin purchases and what not goes to 
keeping the game up and running. It isn't free to host these things and to 
develop these things and people seem to forget that. EVERYTHING COSTS 
SOMETHING. Stop treating the people who brought you the game like ****

But your negative attitude is probably what keeps this game from running happily. I see this as an opportunity to quit sitting still in front of a screen for a few minutes. Be happy you have a game to play not ***** and complain that they dont hand you what you want on a silver platter 

My negative attitude? I have my right and freedoms as a human being. Honestly i'm not mad or even irradiated. I've never payed for this game once. And i really don't expect nothing from riot. All i'm saying is the truth. And im not here to disagree with people, in fact i actually agree to with most of everything you said.

Ok so we agree mostly but as i see it it isn't donations.. But as you said they have to pay for their employees and such... where do you think our skin money goes? Paying employees... and research. I'm not a dumb woman I just hate all the people bashing a free to play game that when it isn't down is actually very good. I apologize for biting back but people have been attacking my opinion all day wanting things just given to them.

It's a free game that makes revenue and more importantly profit. When they 
stop making profit, they will shut the game down. As far as I'm concerned, 
I havent been rude towards them, I just stated facts. Moreover, do you are 
that naive that you believe they keep getting the revenue JUST for keep 
the game running? Do you think the CEO'S and big guys dont want some 
profit in their pockets?You've a weak point and you keep repeating 
it over and over again. Show me different points or shut up.You're 
really naive ma'am. If they really cared about their players, they'd have 
prioritized their servers over automatic ban tools, not saying it's not 
important tho.a7f1e715c6602f62

-------------------

Does anyone complaining about the server problems know what "DDOS" means?

-------------------

Grouping people like me into the general populace is where fights break out. I don't support this game and i never will. I play it for fun not competition.   Yes yes i know i play it for fun right? WTF... Lol since when are video games made not allowing people to have fun in?  Riot has given me more than what i paid for. I got hours of time playing with friends and winning game and the occasional happy dance after getting a few wins.  Ps: I paid $0.00

To all the people complaining and want RP for this. *gives out 1 RP to everyone*. There. There's your RP.

Ok sir, if you want a new point then fine here is one. Even with all the 
complaining and all the harsh and negative words is anything getting done 
to solve the problem by you or other summoners? No it is not. And if all 
riot can do is focus on giving into what everyone wants then they wont 
have time to fix any issues whatsoever. if you dont see this then you are 
the naive one. I am just making a point that people need to leave them the 
hell alone... And you definitely need to not attack people just for 
defending a game they love. You have a good point on some things but you 
are harsh and definitely set on your line of thinking. No one can suede a 
concrete mind and I dont plan to try to do so. Just take it easy on the 
game. Go bother some other company that is pay to play for having the same 
problems the free to play ones have. Because last i checked ALL games have 
the same problems

People refuse to see things from both sides. Call each other naive back and forth and back and forth kinda sums that up.

-------------------

Keep in mind its impossible for us to see things from riots point of view. In the end this is an unwinnable argument. Not that it really matters anyways right?

Yeap, all games have this problem. The difference is how fast they solve 
and how proactive they are. Take this example, Tibia experienced a lot of 
attacks. Nowadays, if it happens, they take a day to fix it or even less. 
If the issue persists, they offer a benefit for the players. Tibia runs 
like League of Legends, free to play with special features for people that 
are willing to pay.Riot is a big target and so far, they are not 
trying to change anything. They just act when they are attacked. If they 
keep doing this behaviour, sooner or later people will get tired and will 
move to different platforms or games, such as DOTA 2.I have never 
attacked YOU, I was talking about your option and how it lacks support. It 
doesn't mean that I think that you are dumb or a sh.ithead. I just think 
you a little bit too naive towards how companies truly work.a7f1e715c6602f62

[5:07] d99e4f9d054e3336: you are a sad pathetic man. I will pray for you and your future life  She couldn't take the arguments and because of my policy towards the game she thinks I'm sad and pathetic. ***** please. Go learn how to debate and develop better arguments

-------------------

Lol im currently in a game! It's back!

-------------------

I think i'm done. Disconnected me in a ranked game. This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE!

-------------------

As soon as the message popped up on the little information screen, i joined a game. then immediately disconnected and wasn't able to do anything for 5 min. i just exited after that,just saying as of NOW, it is not working lol

-------------------

Lol and then servers go down in the middle of a game. Sure it's nice that there's "Loss prevented" in ranked..But let's be real here, I didn't lose LP ok fine, but who the **** cares. This game is becoming such a waste of time. Get on to play a game for fun, just to find out its lagging and everyone is d/cing. Imagine the amount of time wasted by everyone sitting here hoping servers will stabilize. I would just leave the game and save my time but guess what? Then people get reported for leaving and get banned etc. Sure the game might be difficult to maintain with people ddosing and what not, but guess what? As a gaming company it's your responsibility to keep things running smoothly. As a gamer, our responsibility is to invest our time and money in your company, and maybe even being a good community. But Riot you have disappointed us, you're unable to keep up your side of the deal.

-------------------

DC'd from 2/2 ranked games today for no reason. Too close to my series for servers to suck this bad. plz make it work consistently! D:

-------------------

My team has more turrets up in this ranked game. When the server is fixed i would have already won. Lol this is hilarious. Riot you crack me up.

-------------------

Give me back my promotional.......  I won my promotional right as the server went down, and now the game doesn't show that the match I was playing in ever existed.  Thank you Riot, I appreciate this. :/

-------------------

This has been going on for at least 3 weeks and I have not had one loss prevented

-------------------

Couple of days my ass! riot is busy making money and not taking care of the server correctly. did the riot staff change after the season 3? whats going on this season? all riot does is that they come up with all these new stuff and having players to pay for all these skins and **** but they arent focusing on the basic stuff which is maintaining the server the right way. greedy bastards. im sure riot is gonna either remove this reply or ban my account. im sure of it. cuz they do everything else but maintaining.

Look at the bright side. Keep 2 windows open. LoL and another game. As soon as LoL crashes alt tab and farm that free IP.

There are alot of mobas out there, kinda like but not really. I believe this year alone 5 or 6 new Beta mobas were just released. Might be worth investing some time to research this up while ur alt tabbed and farming IP.

-------------------

If this keeps happening they are gonna lose a huge fan base. What happens to sports with no fan base? Hockey.

-------------------

Needless to say LoL and Dota are the most popular, but new mobas open new doors for different people. While it may not be popular, i can still be more fun.

-------------------

Wow, I'm really fed up with this. Just disable ranked queues for a month if you're having DDOS attacks. I'm probably going to get reported and may not have a loss forgiven. Winning ranked games takes a lot of effort and a lot of team work. I'm sick of losing LP for reasons outside of my control and NOT being re-compensated.  Lack of LP compensation and constant downtime is unacceptable. It's a free game, but I still pay RP, and so do many others...so I consider myself a paying customer. Right now, LoL is unplayable. I'll be finding a new game to play.

-------------------

Because of this i lost my ranked game, lost my series... Uve pissed me off. U better give me Some free rp if u want me to Forgive ur ass

-------------------

well i am getting to the point i am just done.i will only play when my friend is off work. this game is going just like conqueronline went. was great then the fan base grew and they didnt ask for donations or anything to keep up with the volume and fell apart and everyone quit playing. thx for caring riot

-------------------

riot you didn't care when u screw ppl in rank and placement with trolls & afkers  you didn't care when you release obv op champs just to get paid  you didn't care when you banned ppl for dumb things  now you're lying in your bed that you made, nobody cares about your 'reasons'... perform or fail

riot, thanx for such a wonderful game, so magical, we can flay frm one plac to anothr in a splits second, evn portal 2 should b ashamed. U R D Best.

You get a free room. But you buy a bed. You get free food, but you buy some ketup. Your room and meals are still free tho...

-------------------

This is actually good to know, wondering why out of nowhere the server has been lagging

-------------------

okay guys i guess runescape it is

-------------------

What a great idea was it to start ranked this week end. Finally gave up trying to play in that last game and left as both sides had nobody else. Incoming leavwer ban i guess?  They really need to disable ranked when these situations arise.

-------------------

Its fine that you finally admit to being DDOSed. But to say that its only been going on for the past couple days???? Just so you can justify your lack of action in implementing loss prevented policy earlier??? This has been going on for 3 WEEKS. Why are you waiting till NOW to implement loss prevented???? This is FING BS!

-------------------

I think it's funny how you continuously blame the DDoS attacks for server instability, but we never see you owning your mistakes as a company. That's poor business ethic. You know damn well there is money to be invested in the server security and you're not doing it. Stop lying to us and giving us this "There's nothing we can do about DDoS" and just get your **** together.

-------------------

i cant even play this game anymore league of legends will no longer allow me to sign in since i was lag booted from a ranked match i don't think its fair people are going down multiple ranks trying to get to a certain rank because of lag issues fix it please this is rediculous

-------------------

Buying RP is equal for both sides. You on one hand get in game items to enjoy your game. While they get money. Asking to be compensated is asking too much. Its still a free to play game.  Seeing as how you get and they get. Only way to make this equal is, if those lack, you lack.   If their servers are ****, just stop paying them. Don't do the opposite and ask for something in return, that way they know they got you by the hook.

-------------------

Just tried to play a ranked game, and was finishing champ select as they shut down ranked queues. The game froze at the end of champ select, and couldn't connect us to the game. Trying to circumvent this issue, I logged out and attempted to log back in. This was 20 minutes ago, and my queue wait time has gradually increased to 2 hours. So much for series.

You are right, it should be 
EQUAL ON BOTH SIDES, but it isn't, we pay a lot of money for the game and it helps fund them for various projects, however the amount of money they netted in for one game alone is astronomical but somehow the quality in game is not matching up to how much money people spent on it as a whole.

-------------------

This is getting ridiculous. Don't these attackers have anything better to do than ruin everyone's fun? This is why things are the way they are these days. Some bad eggs do crappy stuff ruining things for everyone else because they are angry or the hate whoever they are attacking, but at the same time they are bothering innocents who just want to play and have fun and they can't because someone else is too busy screwing up their game time. This road only leads to things getting harder for everyone else instead of helping things get better if this is what they had in mind. This same road also causes more restrictions on stuff to be made. Things may be taken away. Costs may raise. They don't think about this when they do these things. All they care about are themselves and their agenda. Screw whoever else is involved apparently. Probably a bunch of lil whine-bags who got perma-banned for something in the first place. If you're pissed of at Riot then leave everyone else out of it. Stop ruining our fun.

-------------------

Riot, I'm done with you. All the money i've spent on league of legends, I want it back. Refund please.....

-------------------

People people please. Riot is try. Being mean is not help. You pay money, they try fix, you get mad. Stop get mad. Only make worse.

-------------------

It is getting old spending more time trying to get back into the game then you do actually playing in it.....hope this is fixed soon and hope we get more time with double IP

Welcome to the world of corporation. One side is getting money from 5,000,000 other different sides. Of course it wont seem equal. Individually its equal, economically its not.

I've been lagging quite a bit today, at the moment I'm stuck in the login queue, position over 20,000, approx. wait time 1hr 2min.  What's up?

0f87bdf061f865d2:

-------------------

So, the riot servers were giving my game a hard time, but i pushed on. I just kept staying in the game, not exiting it or nothing, and i got the best reward a league player could ask for. I was the first and only to connect! Besides our Rammus connecting at the end. So the server did disconnected my again about 3 times, but then after the 3rd time, it was pretty stable, more than my normal ping, but stable. And i was able to push all the way to the enemy nexus. That's when our rammus reconnected! I waited for him until he reached the enemy nexus and we had a dance party after i last-shot the enemy nexus. It was the best victory ever. lol, this will probably be the only time this will happen, but i'm wearing a huge smile on my face as i look at my match history and see yet another victory. c45220991adbf353 out.

-------------------

Wohoooo six consecutive losses in ranked cause infinte dcÂ´s come from nowhere, though was me or the pc, and people would say why did you play ranked? A= Man, how the hell am I supposed to know when IÂ´m going to have huge lag spikes!? IÂ´m not even sure if my mates were horrible or IÂ´m the rockie or if is everyone disconecting. ThatÂ´s why I return from IV to V, well was my decision to continue playing with a random, and dangerous risk, I cant try it again. In each game mode was the same, so i didnÂ´t care anymore, and I pleyed ranked with dc or without them, but a miracle or imaganative reason, the only one I won was when I wasnÂ´t dc or lagging... Those ddos have mostly a year attacking the servers... how can you not fix it for more than a year? The one or the group thatÂ´s behind that is/are geniu(s), cause a big company canÂ´t solve it with so much time, and resources. I know that Sony and Microsft have the same problems... so well I guess we canÂ´t blame you for those conflicts. The only I want is: GIVE US AN ADVERTISEMENT WITH ENORMOUS LETTERS, THAT NEED TO BE CLOSED MANUALLY AFTER 5 TO 10 SECS, TELLING US, THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME CONNECTION ISSUES AFTER LOGIN TO THE GAME, AND DISABLE RANKED GAMES, PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND, AND WONÂ´T BLAMING YOU THAT YOU ARE WASTING THEIR TIME (ALSO IS THEIR FAULT, BUT SHHHH!), AND MONEY. Maybe the could ENJOY more the game than before (forget TROLLS, AND FEEDERS, THEYÂ´LL FOREVER EXIST).

-------------------

For the money you alone paid, the game has given you more than your share. But keep in mind your playing a game that you alone didn't pay for. You cant complain.

You're wrong though, and i bolded the parts i wanted to touch on. 

We Don't get our in game items, as the servers wont allow us to play with them. It's also not just about "oh we've spend 5-10$ here or there" some people have been playing this game for a while and invested money in to this company. That's what dedicated players who spend money are- Investors. We have create revenue for Riot, and in turn the supply us with a game we can play. When we have invested several hundred dollars in to this game over the course of a few years (about 4 in my case)we expect something in return- a game that works. People asking for some sort of monetary compensation aren't asking for every champ to be unlocked and free skins for a life time- they just want Riot to give a little back to the people who have given to them. So when the servers are down on a day that many of us have off, we can't help but to be frustrated. Yes, they have us as consumers, but what incentive do we have to keep supplying them with publicity/money when they can't keep the main aspect active? 

We're a consumer public. If you don't care about your public you don't last long.

You are horribly wrong, a lot of big gaming corporations have invested money into upgrading their equipment to match with the quality of other competitors and to stay current with technology, Microsoft, Blizzard, Valve, Twitch, Youtube, Google, and others still spend money on improvements, Riot Games is not poor enough to upgrade, they are just trying to see how long they can milk us until everyone folds.

-------------------

The money YOU gave them may cover a technician to fix 1gb of their server space.

-------------------

I have this crazy idea ... where instead of Riot spending all its time and resources on making new skins, champs for people to spend their hard earned money on and reworking art for champs most people don't give two flying s**ts about, INSTEAD Riot spends its time fixing their god-awful server issues that have been plaguing the community for the better half of the last year ... you know,so people who spend their money on the game CAN ACTUALLY PLAY THE GOD DAMN GAME! Seriously, I haven't been able to log on for more than 2-3 days at a time all this year without Riot claiming to be experiencing "disconnection/lag issue" with the NA server. Do you guys seriously just reset your servers and cross your damn fingers? Because every 2-3 days you guys are claiming to have server issues. How about you actually FIX the issues instead of saying you've resolved them only for them to arise again 2 days later and persist for several days beyond that. If you guys were a hotel you'd be rated 1 star at best, because instead of caring about people actually ENJOYING the experience, all you people care about is UP-SELLING champs and skin to make more profit on a game that doesn't work 60% of the time. To be frank, I don't give a rat's ass if I'm being ill-mannered, I'm saying what the majority of the community has been thinking for a long time, and in a way that MIGHT actually reflect the level of frustration we feel every day with your product. Keep putting a half-ass effort into your pathetic servers and I guarantee you another game is going to come along, take your clients and put an end to this pitiful charade.

-------------------

I'll play league when ever i am able to, and i love to play this game. BUT... Riot if you are getting DDOS'ed it is your job to fix the issue. I've spent at least 300 dollars on RP and wont buy any more till you fix your game. I know finding the people doing this is complicated, but dude that 300+ dollars is a lot of money and i cant see my skins when i like cause of this bs. Sugar rush is even here and i want annie in wonderland but i will stick to my guns. Sorry Riot i love you but i cant spend money on something that doesn't work the way it should

You are horribly wrong, a lot of big gaming corporations have invested money into upgrading their equipment to match with the quality of other competitors and to stay current with technology, Microsoft, Blizzard, Valve, Twitch, Youtube, Google, and others still spend money on improvements, Riot Games is not poor enough to upgrade, they are just trying to see how long they can milk us until everyone folds. 

Show me facts that Riot is not doing this. Give me a link to a quote from riot them selves. You cant tell me im wrong on an opinion i made myself, while you dont have any evidence to back up your own stories.

Twenty- Seven- Million. Now imagine even HALF of them spending over $100+ a year. Oh and it's growing. OH and that doesn't count the money gained from all the publicity that goes on in championships, events, and other funding they get. They aren't just some indie developers sitting in a basement, you know that right?

Been playing this game since season 1, but I will be leaving forever. I can't stand the lag, d/c, and lack of effort put forth by this organization to compensate its customers. I've never seen a game who was as stingy in compensating the players. You can find me on Hawken.

Those numbers are not pulled out of nowhere, they have been collected by other places such as stock portfolios or online, your numbers/reasons are completely made up though.

Your backing up your story with a poll with not even 1000 voters? 1000/ the million of plays. 

These are not facts, these are forum post people like you or me created. Unless you show us quotes from Riot them selves or legit researched statistics, you are still gonna be a hypocrite .

Yup, and if you followed any media such as the Lizard Squad twitter, you can also see that they cant even scratch Twitch, Microsoft, or DOTA 2.

If you know anything about statistics you should know that taking data from a population that is more than 10% it would give bad results.

You commies need to stop defending Riots server instability. The cause is irrelevant. They run a business for which they receive HUGE profits from. They are the ones that have the responsibility to deliver a quality product. They are not doing that. They either need to figure their **** out, or go out of business, and thats what eventually will happen.  There are no excuses in capitalism

alright but my game's over and it keeps telling me to reconnect back to a game that's been over with after I've re-logged 6 times. I just want to play and can't because the game is rather confused.

-------------------

What I thinks funny about this whole thing is that Riot can literally do nothing to stop it. The reason its "resolved" is because the 3rd party chooses to stop DDOS'ing then Riot posts "We've resolved it". Just bothers me how they cant stop it.  Sorry if me saying this angers anyone or somewhere along the line I just misinterpreted something. Good luck Riot. Thanks for reading.

Im not sure how DDoS works, or how to stop/block it. But if DDoS's could be blocked by regular poeple like you or me, im sure the phrase DDoS wouldn't exist. You cant expect people to fix things you don't know how to fix. None of us are even sure if Riot does. We assume they do, and maybe they do, but we cant prove it

Umm this sounds pretty dumb but today, i played a few games and the most recent game i played ended in a surrender. But when i got back on my account, it says I HAVE TO RECONNECT TO A GAME, but the thing is I havent played a single game and disconnected so what do I do?  Plx help me cause I have no idea what to do and yes i have tried reconnecting but its taken me like a full 45 mins and my screen is still black.....

-------------------

Wow. Great double IP weekend Riot. So nice that there are lag issues today. Are we going to get an extra day of this double IP? I have been unable to log in and the one game I played was just a **** fest of not being able to see or do anything while my team just yelled at me.

-------------------

Sigh, I can't play a single game without having incredibly weird and unplayable lag in game. +1 Rito

-------------------

I still have massive lags, "recovered at this time" my ass, and no loss forgiven...

-------------------

Just had an entire game stop mid-laning phase. Everyone froze, with the "reconnecting bar" still pertinent. No one moving or typing, minions still taking towers.

-------------------

Log in says Servers are busy and ask my to try again later. K. So i go on the forums and LoL's website is giving me a 500 internal server error. K. Just K.

-------------------

So I'm confused. I thought these server issues were the result of DDOS attacks from Lizard Squad? But the servers are now lagging etc and they arent DDOSing any more.. Whats going on?

-------------------

Sigh, I'm disappointed. Was hoping to enjoy another day of my favorite game, but yet again, the servers are unplayable.  Hope some kind of security is implemented soon. Every time it's "fixed" it seems like I go into a match and see the same problems.   I feel like I'm being lied to.  And it sucks.

-------------------

Fantastic timing too, last couple of days before classes...

-------------------

Network Operations Â a minute ago    Summoners, we are seeing issues with players disconnecting from game. We have activated loss forgiven while we investigate. Sorry for the inconvenience.   so this happens so often  first why do I care whether someone attacked your data center or not. you are more than a million dollar company and giving useless piece of technical information which I don't care.  second why am I pissed? because you say loss forgiven, I say victory lost, because all the games which I get lost forgiven, our team has completely outmatched the other team, even in some games they wait for surrender. so how are you going to compensate this?  third why do u enable ranked and give false hopes when you cannot fix the attacks permanently. do u think you are the only one in the entire internet who get this attack?, this problem should be easily solvable.   don't think I don't know anything about internet, I am also professional IT Engineer who works for a multinational company so I know how these stuffs work. so stop posting stupid reasons and do something to fix it.

-------------------

Dear riot i hope you can extend the double ip bonus weekend i find it so frustrating not being able to login at all and the servers are out 75% of the time during this weekend please i hope you can do something about it.

-------------------

another ddos attack. why am i not surprised.... seriously how long has it been?

-------------------

Riot, fix your servers please. It seems that it's been ridiculously unstable for the past week or so. It's extremely frustrating. I'm sure that many people have quit playing the game all together because of this. Maybe before you release the new SR map, you should worry about other things, like game stability?

-------------------

release their locations so someone can burn their houses down

-------------------

Realize this. Through out all 55 pages of this Thread Riot has not even replied to anyone. You useless bickering and raging is even more useless.

-------------------

I am telling you, the day the Na server stops having problems is the day.....

-------------------

I mean maybe its just me.. but i dont ****ing understand how you people make millions of dollars and cant even ****ing pay for decent servers....

-------------------

what about the people who bought day boost and now can't play on it

-------------------

oh good now that its normal (4v3) i get loss forgiven but rank before nah. thx alot

-------------------

Riot....im sorry but I cant use the skins i paid for ive invested over $200 in this game hoping in return you would supply us for a decent stable server play. I will be taking a break from this game....for a while after my 7 day spree of loss forgiven and lag server issues..... i wont be spending anymore money on a game that cant even upgrade their servers from us the consumers give you...from skins, champs, icons, and wards. Like i said riot you are my favorite game provider i love LOL but i will be moving to DOTA 2 for a bit i am sorry... RIP until you get your servers stable.

-------------------

Was thinking about buying more RP (since there is a deal going on), but have decided to purchase goods for another game instead since League servers has been too volatile to play.

-------------------

My question is that since this is double IP weekend but the servers have been the attacks, provided the attacks get fixed within this next week will the servers get double IP weekend again as a sort of reimbursement?

-------------------

i dont know but i still know my decision! ^ DOTA here i come! i accept your loving embrace!

-------------------

No seriously wtf? I get back on because there is no longer an announcement saying there is issues and there was no long login queue. Yet I still have a game filled with lag where NO ONE can do anything. WTF Riot at least keep something up telling us your game is being ****. I wouldn't have wasted another 20 minutes on this game if I had known you hadn't managed to fix squat.

-------------------

Really disappointing. Game has been essentially unplayable the last 48 hours.   It would seem reasonable to put some sort of disclaimer on the store noting the server issues. So folks out there wouldn't waste money on IP boosts that just get wasted...

Or disable them for the time being. They say they care but then take your money for a service they can't provide. Funny how the world works.

-------------------

**** riot, this is the most backward system ever. I get kicked out of game because your stupid ass NA servers and then it gives me a leavebuster and now I can't play for 7 days. Go suck a dick, November 11th(WoD) can't come quick enough. ****ing tired of this stupid ass ****ing game.

"Attacks".... more like cheap bastards are pissing away all the money we give them on strippers and cocaine. Jesus **** riot please understand this is a direct reflection on what ya'll invest in your servers. "DDOS attacks"  -AJ

Hi I'm from the east coast and I am tired of playing with 100 ping I know you players at Riot have never experienced this ping lag, but let me tell you the difference between 30 ping and 100 ping is very big! With that said Chicago or Texas servers are a must! The majority of the riot employee's and professional players in southern CA are currently on Verizon FiOS and getting about 39-46ms to the Portland servers (which is a little high in my opinion) if you moved the servers to Texas the players in Southern CA would have about 48-55 ping with the correct route of course and probably couldn't even tell a difference, east coasters would ping about 50-60 and the midwest and south of course would have ~35ms. Chicago servers would be a little more focused on the east coasters and to the pacific NW providing ping times of about 55-62 to most of the west coasters including the pros, east coasters would be about 24-35ms. tl dr Portland servers have trash routing, and trash latency's and is a rubbish location to host severs.

-------------------

2000 ping for 10 minutes just cost me ranked game we were winning, cool story riot.

dude i play with a 290 ping, dont complain.

-------------------

They have made it rather clear that they simply do NOT plan on making a NA east server. Riot has dodged the question over and over again. They also will not be moving the server to a centralized location (ie Texas or something), because it would make the west coast too slow (But still 50-100 faster than the east coast is now). All that matters is the NA pros have access to good ping.

I will never understand why people can never see the obvious that Riot really doesn't give a damn about anybody except for the LCS players. I quit buying RP a long time ago. I will NOT support Riot financially when they refuse to do anything to help players.

At least you people are able to log on the client. It wont even start up for me anymore and gives error messages just starting today

It's not Riot's fault that they are being constantly attacked. There is little than can be done about DDOS. Why are you flaming them? I love Riot. This is a free game and they try to please the community as much as possible. I'm confident things will improve, with time.  That said, if Loss prevention isn't added to my latest ranked debacle lag/disconnect war, I may be singing a different tune entirely.

-------------------

I love how people don't understand that there is different group or rioters for each things they do.

-------------------

I CANT LOG ON. 2 DAYS STRAIGHT CANNOT LOG ON WHILE ALL MY FRIENDS ARE ON. I WANNA KNOW WHEN I CAN LOG ON, but in the meantime there is playoffs so i wouldnt be playing anyways.

-------------------

****ed me up 2 rankeds already, waiting it out will be the best

-------------------

I'm getting "attempting to reconnect" often over the past 8 hours. My internet connection seems to be fine (low latency and no packet loss to Google, my personal server on Amazon AWS, etc). I've restarted everything. Any ideas on when this will be fixed?

-------------------

still happening to me as well!!!! cant play at all

-------------------

https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=I5laPTP1bYY#t=1000 I saw this video. But yep, I'm getting screwed over too. I lost 2 ranked games and many normals/arams because of the dc.

-------------------

Hey EVERYONE, in the last couple of weeks our servers being used by millions of players have been taken down by a few neckbeards in their mommies basement who named theirselfs after a reptile. We only are a multi million dollar company, and cannot stop this. Good luck!

-------------------

was in a custom game by myself and I felt the DDoS!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCNrSFNPe4A

-------------------

Just happened to me in a game that I got finished with as well as the Teemo on the other side. Any chance you can run through the game logs and retroactively apply loss forgiven to these kind of games instead of just enabling loss prevention at certain points?

-------------------

my mac is not downloading/installing the game. please help with this problem ASAP!! i am miss out on the fun due to this, hope you be able to get it fix.

-------------------

I have to be honest playing league is becoming less fun and more stressful with all the lag spikes, dcs and what not and making it a much more hostile environment all around. I'm missing time in gmes and plays and people are getting mad, i'm getting mad, and this game is just becoming another unplayable game. Please fix the lag, or if it's just this server, give free transfers to another that doesnt have this issue.. Better have happy players moving to other servers, than pissed off players uninstalling the game.

-------------------

I honestly can't even spectate games without it losingdata and crashing every 5 minutes.

-------------------

according to riot this is fixed thats why no admins have posted or replied xD

-------------------

http://cards.giveawaycow.net/?i=pAbx0Y what about this.

-------------------

I'm getting really tired of this bull. I can't even play the game anymore, I'm lagging so hard. And it's probably another thing that couldn't have been helped, but it sucks doubly to have all this happening on double IP weekend. And LABOR DAY weekend too, when we all have off Monday and get to play more :S

-------------------

I thought they had caught the DDOSers... why is my ping still 200+

-------------------

My SPF was 60 and my ping was only 80(both of my ping and SPF are good),but my game my game is extremely and extraordinary lagging and keeps disconnected. My friends and I are getting so mad about this. This game server sucks. Pleas fix the lag problem as soon as possible.

RIOT just shut down the server until it's fixed ffs

-------------------

Random dc every few seconds, ping randomly jumped to 1700+ at one point, games end with people still in them, players are dc'ing left and right, this is kinda ridiculous after three days of the same. And during the double ip weekend too.

what about this. 

Doesn't work like you would think. You have to get people to click THEN fillout a survey and complete a paid offer for anything to work so no it's not worth it.

Seriously. Letting people on the servers just gives them the illusion that they can play, and makes them 10x angrier when there are problems. 

Riot, if defending against DDOS is an arms race, maybe you should, I don't know, put some more arms in that race. Otherwise, it makes you either 1. look like you have no idea what you're talking about or 2. not being upfront with your playerbase about what's really going on. Neither of which are good PR. 

Honesty is the least you could do for your customers, especially the ones who paying.

-------------------

at least you guys can play the game probably around 90% of mac users can't even update to patch 4.15 so consider your selves lucky.

Over sixteen months of instability on North America. League of Legends.

-------------------

https://i.imgur.com/DLy1jQd.png  Rubberbanding and lagging. "Attempting to reconnect" with 97 ping. Dc'ing occasionally. ALL of this while ONLY playing League.  Meanwhile, I downloaded SMITE yesterday and enjoyed watching twitch streams while playing SMITE lag free. Did I mention that their amazing graphics and game load PRONTO. I barely have time to do anything while the load screen occurs. I think I've found a new moba for the foreseeable future. At least until I hear that RIOT gets their house in order.  My recommendation? Cut your programmers and network admins pay because you're definitely not getting your monies worth with such a buggy game and piss poor NA network.

This right here is the main reason I'm pissed. I put all my other 3 day weekend plans on hold for this once in a blue moon opportunity to fill up my rune pages faster. Riot should probably reschedule this double ip weekend (not like they really have to but it would be nice).

-------------------

YUP... no one cares that no one cares.... This has now been ongoing for at least 12-15hrs... and not one "RED" update of acknowledgement... smh

-------------------

Would like an update? i'm lvl 5 now on EU west, and no lag. But I cannot play on NA server. And I'm in North America.

-------------------

Quote: 

785acc1443cca485: 

So much lag over the past 24hrs I cannot play. 

Just a slideshow of bouncing around the map rubber banding everywhere. 

All other net connections work fine. 

I have time warner internet. 

I don't get disconnected, just rubberband. I'll have a ping of 700ms then a ping of 100. I can ping google.com with 32-40ms pings. 

That's a good point, on a good day my ping to the LoL server is 100-110. On a bad day it's 200-800. But every day my ping to google is 40 ms.

-------------------

I have been getting frequent disconnects in game since 8/31/2014. Makes LOL unplayable... still unresolved by riot.

-------------------

well at least you working on it.....

-------------------

So is LoL being ddos'd by other people now or what?

-------------------

The client is telling me I've left a game in progress, but no such thing is true.

-------------------

attackers always have the advantage in situations such as this. It's not easy to differentiate between legitimate traffic and spoofed attacks.

-------------------

Guess what, servers crashed again, cant get on and cant get into my ranked game.... again Rito fix pls

-------------------

**** you riot ****ing fix your ****!!!!!!!! /hiss

-------------------

really "recent" your servers have always been this bad its time to find a new company to handle them or tell them to fix it immediately this is ridiculous my internet is top of the line and I have an alienware so the lag is allllll on you guys. especially in my games right this minute the worst servers ive seen. Runescape in 1999 had better servers than you

-------------------

The Lag is real! this is starting to get crazy, no wonder I cant keep my ranking when i'm lagging the whole game

-------------------

looks like you guys gotta turn it on again, or just shut down rank games til the entire problem is solved

-------------------

Sooooo umm, Riot, why don't you make a back up server for those of us in Canada, and seperate the different sections of US by north south east west?

-------------------

no wonder so many people have quit this game for better games smite being the top of them.

-------------------

no response from the server, the server is busy, cant enter queue, champ select glitching.....i thought this was fixed or was i bugging when i seen its been taken care of....no its not my internet im the only one on it at the moment and it has worked fine before

Rekt. ... Sorry Riot, but this is inexcusable at this point. NA servers have been **** for months/years now. Give us an east coast server and clean your existing servers up. Please.

-------------------

smite>league of trash

-------------------

there is also a problem with reconnecting to the game. Im not sure if this question has been brought up or not. There are times where my client would say server is busy and won't let me get on. Will I get a time penalty for this if my client crashes or if I get forced logged out due to laggs?

see most companies who cared about their customers would do what they could to make them happier. riot on the other hand just wants money and doesn't care what happens to its customers. this is why in a few years riot will be a curbside company. most companies would also pay compensation for their neglect to certain things I know many games who give out free stuff because of a screw up on their end. one of them being Trion. take a hint from the riot. I promise it will keep people from quitting this horrible server ridden game. 

p.s. there is a east coast server its called LAN but you can only listen to it in Espanol even though its server is based in florida sad right? priorities these days with riot

-------------------

sigh

-------------------

In my series and game just crashes... Love you riot.. (sarcasm)

-------------------

Even though "Loss Prevention" is turned on, it still counts as a "lost" if you're in series X _ _.

-------------------

Server down midgame and now i cant even log in. Queue says position 1 time 1 second then resets to 8 seconds continually. Pretty fun...

-------------------

Small companies can fix things and backtrack on ddosers, but a company like Riot can't? Maybe you should hire some professional hackers to figure it out like the FBI does.

So, basically the insane amount of money I have spent on playing league is now actually wasted? I haven't been able to play a game without issues in 2 weeks. Can I have my money back? You can take the skins back, I apparently don't need them, I can't fricking play a damn game

sorry they care more about money and the LCS than the majority of their money makers.

-------------------

won 2 games of ranked and received no points because of these issues.. I'm not asking for points back. Starting to hate this game. Right when I think I'm close to promo- get robbed.

-------------------

2hr 31 min to log back in.. were actually paying to play a free to play game...

-------------------

I was just in my promo, and lost the game because everyone d/c'd pretty much.  Still waiting to see if it counts as one of my three games, if so that's messed up. :/

-------------------

Thank you Riot.

-------------------

yeah this is ridiculous. Riot is seems to be the only company really struggling with this DDoS problem. Im starting to doubt its attacks and maybe just hardware problems

-------------------

this kinda sucks. I'm a huge league fan and have been playing for a year. I'm considering stopping. the game is great but the amount of time i spend frustrated about not being able to play every night isn't so great.

-------------------

What the hell is this~! Hoenstly, I was in a R-A-N-K-E-D game, I got disconnected THE FIRST time during these attacks, my computer is state of the art - my wifi is ****ing amazing, I run on 20 ping, so WHAT THE HELL IS THIS. God. I was WINNING my lane, and my jungler was winning, and bam - all of a sudden my ENTIRE team dcs - then I dc, and come back just when the other WHOLE team ends it... meanwhile my entire fking team is dced. like REALLY? god im so choked.

-------------------

Not to be rude but Blizzard gets DDoS'd alot as well, they flip and switch and its over, as a big name in gaming why don't you ask their advice and see if they'll share the secret switch info?

-------------------

Quote: 

5e67716a07f4200d: 

These services may be successful for other games, but there's one thing you have to take into consideration. Any time you add a DDoS protection to a network, you have to consider the implications of doing so. 

We're already in the process of adding multiple different levels of protection, but each step of the way, we have to ensure that we've accurately tested these services. If we didn't test them thoroughly, we could shoot ourselves in the foot before we even start protecting our servers. One large problem we've seen is once we turn on mitigation, latency increases by a large amount. With this latency increase you have essentially taken down the service yourself. 

Another thing that I've mentioned in previous threads is that when you have such large attacks against your network, you have to work with many different ISPs/groups to ensure traffic is being properly blocked. I can't give too much detail, but this is something we're always actively doing, as well as making network changes to give us more control over our network service as a whole. 

If there are any specific questions, I'll do my best to answer them, but remember, one of the reasons we can't share a lot about what we're doing is because it's always a game of cat and mouse. We don't want to show our hands about our defense, just as much as the attackers don't want to share too much about their attacks. 

Would latency be a problem if there were both west and east coast servers? :\ 

Why won't you guys split NA? I mean, what's the reason if it's not money? Then you can use DDoS protection because the latency is already down, right?

-------------------

Wow. Well thanks alot for having my account banned based on YOUR reconnection issues. Well done riot -__- This is bs

-------------------

Give Riot a break. DDOS is not easy to defend against and if you look at a world map of the actual attacks, destination to destination, the sheer volume of them is incredible. Consider that a DDOS attack involves a matrix of corrupted information that could be let's say 200x bigger than what the server can handle, among other things:  http://www.digitalattackmap.com/understanding-ddos/ (http://www.digitalattackmap.com/understanding-ddos/)

We haven't got another Red post on this **** thread in over a week now.

-------------------

and honestly when was the last real update they applied to the game that didn't have some problem with an item, lag, or a champion having to be disabled? that on top of the bad servers is destruction for a company

-------------------

It would be awesome if you would post updates on how your "Tale" is doing.

yep in number 1 in the que but apparently it takes 40 minutes for 1 person to get through. We really know whats happening tho. Riot is like the kid who gets too drunk at parties. they just can't handle their ****.

-------------------

DO NOT THANK THESE PEOPLE THEY ARE NOT DOING **** these people are rich as **** have all the money they need to create newer and better protected servers but instead they want to make us deal with it till the DOS attacks stop and we all know they wont stop until there either dead or in prison so dont **** with us tell us the truth and make a stand to do something about it. it is your ****ing job to fix a game regardless if its your fault you have a way to fix it yall just wanna be greedy and not spend a dime on new servers

-------------------

My favorite part is waiting in queue for 40 minutes and then the client crashing.

1. If they weren't money hungry wouldn't we have better servers?

-------------------

Being a person who had worked on servers before. I understand that getting the right equipment and software can be costly, but riot you have alot of people playing your game. Do you honestly think that you are using your money wisely but investing it in promotions of the game when there are so many issues "logging on" or "gameplay". I ask you invest more of your money in promoting the stability in game and keeping people playing. Do you honestly think people will keep playing if this continues. They wont.

I keep spending money on this damn game....my fault. I have no idea why I keep believing the **** you guys are posting about resolving this issue or that. I also do not understand how you can make a serious push at being a true e-sport, when you cant even keep your servers up. I watched the feel good promo videos of RIOT at work. 1200 employees?

Don't fool yourself into thinking the casual playerbase brings in more profit than LCS sponsors

-------------------

Idk, companies like Blizzard shut down their servers when things go wrong and they seem to have their stuff fixed a lot faster. If completely shutting down the server would fix it faster, I would rather that then sitting here trying to log and being stuck at 1 out of 1 forever.

rofl would they even have a game like it is today and how big it was if they didn't have people like me who paid for aloooot of stuff? no the game would still be small time and they wouldn't of expanded. so without me and others like me they wouldn't have any sponsors. I bid you good day sir. 

Don't get me wrong, the millions upon millions of people that started the league boom brought it to where it is now, but I'm doubtful that we're the ones sustaining it at this point in time.

lol, i cant log on at all this is bullcrap, why would people DDOS my sweet sweet riot servers =( tfw you cant log in for 4 hours straight.

Welcome to the big leagues, congrats on making money. Now invest some of that hard earned cash into improving the game by getting rid of log in ques, more servers, better servers, and if its DDOS attacks then put money into better security   Mo money mo problems...

As "bf8f0dea6b237ec4" said a few minutes ago. If customer service doesn't improve people will stop playing this game.   I don't know if I am the first (doubt it) but I am done with this game. I have spent over $100 on this game (skins, rune pages, etc) and over $100 on external devices such as headphones, mouse pads and mice.  I can handle the toxicity of the community, its like that in every online game. but when I physically can't even get INTO the game to play it then I get pissed off and I feel I am wasting my time with a company who clearly doesn't care about their "Community"  who profits RIOT more? The pro players and their advertisements or the 22million ppl who play this game almost everyday?  spending money on skins like I have.  It sucks. but so does the service I am provided.

You talk about horrible ethics but you're the one talking **** and being unprofessional; just complaining and complaining on their forums. If you really don't like Riot or no longer supports them with what they're doing, then stop paying them. If you do hike do rugby bike or whatever the **** you do, then go do those while you wait for the game to reach its normal condition... Be patient.

I am not a computer expert by any means so I will ask a really stupid Q:  how is it that when the NA regionals were being played live, I can't play LoL due to the inability to login, but I can watch them play?  Is the Regionals hard wired (or something) so that DDOS doesn't effect them?   why can't we get that same hard wired effect for the public?   Another thought.... DDOS attacks: is it actually DDOS attacks or is there something deeper but its acting like a DDOS attack? hopefully you computer techs can think on it and figure it out, GLHF #LizardSquadSttikesAgain #CrushThoseReptilesPlease

LCS Games are held on private servers that are not public on LAN, it is essentially impossible to DDOS a server that is not accessible by any computer, our servers are public so any computer can access it, DDOS Attacks have a lot of different ways of denying service, but the gist of it is that either bots simulate a bunch of computers or a lot of user computers get ridden with viruses and then they request an obscene amount of information from the servers and it just blows it all up because servers have a very hard time distinguishing from what is a phantom computer from a real one, especially when hundreds of millions of requests happen all at once. 

Lizard Squad is a mystery to us all, some people think they are just claiming the DDOS Attacks and hacks but not actually doing it. I feel like they might be a scapegoat from the real terrorists and people will waste time finding them instead of the real guys because they are not the real threat. Also they haven't announced DDOS Attacking our servers in a very long time either, despite the many many many times we all get DCD and the servers blew up because supposedly the FBI caught a few of their goons (but we don't know the real truth either).

That happens to me too, it kicks you out then you can't reconnect so then you have to restart your com just to join the match again.

Please fix ur packet loss east coast

Riot please fix your problems so I can enjoy the game again. I may have to go somewhere else

Good luck trying to fight the attack. the best known way is to have network analyzer 24/7 and shutting down IP addresses as they come through. but even then it wont stop them. Hopefully they grow up and leave the gaming industry alone. For everyone saying fix your problem, its harder said the done. Stop complaining its extremely hard to catch or stop them.

i have a problem hat when i reinstalled league it said this objct already exists after i deleted the riot folder and everything lol related.

-------------------

My view point is drop the act, if your being attacked then attack back. I made my own 3 computer Viruses when i was 13 and still to this day when i get a virus or am attacked on my PC i retrace and if you have the right equipment you can easily pinpoint the location "if" they have more than one transmitter and spike there entire system shutting them. This would give you a few days while they repair to set up stronger defenses. My laptop is unhackable duo top to my own 3 viruses i have created i use as my defense. you touch me i fry your circuts, so on so fourth. i dont work for you so i can not legally do this for u to give u time but you need to figure out an offense and do it secretlly they cant point fingers at you when they started this war now can they. Common sense goes farther than book smarts guys. Best of Luck hope you get this resolved.

-------------------

How about just making a kickstarter with special rewards for those who donated certain amounts?  For example have the community vote for six champions to receive special skins for the donations. If people donate at all they get an icon, if they donate $10 they get one of the six skins, $25 gets two, $50 gets three, $100 gets all the skins. Oh and the skins would be divided among champions primary roles, tank, support, marksman, fighter, mage, and assassin. So people would vote for which tank they want a special skin to go to, as well as which fighter, etc.   You might think that this is a lot of money considering the community size, especially if people donate to get all the skins, my idea is to reinvest that money and to make a secondary server access point, so that way people on the east coast can have resolved latency issues, since the population of the New England region of the US is so high and have more than enough people to make it worth you while.  This is just an idea, I'm pretty sure there are better ways to go about it, however I have seen that money is one issue involved. One last proposition if there is so much more than is needed for both projects, maybe you could create a third access point in the mid-west or south region of the US, and if there is still excess maybe the top 100 donators get up to $100 in riot points, next 100 gets up to $50, then the next 100 get up to $25, and everyone else who donates gets $10 in riot points. All of this benefit for both parties should make it more worth your while to help fix these issues with latency from attacks and from distance from the main server.

I swear league has the worst connection/servers of any game. It's not fair because the game is very fun. I don't understand why we people on the East coast can't have a stable connection to the game (doesn't have to be perfect) with sub 50 ping.

So Riot posts that they are sorry on a forum for their servers and everything is okay? That's ridiculous. Some of you guys are even saying thank you? Out of every game that I have ever played, I've never seen a second rate game like this one. I can't wait for a decent MOBA to come out so I could leave this pathetic game.

-------------------

Thanks

-------------------

So glad that the freakin lag is back. Nothing like running up to your opponent and standing there while they murder you.   Thanks RIOT

Not just East coast. I'm in Texas. Lag is terrible here. Best part is, that my friends and family play the game with me. When one lags, we all lag. Absolutely fantastic when the other team doesn't lag at all. Then they spam you with bullcrap about being better.

-------------------

Not exactly fun to lose a match because the servers went down and booted your whole team. Especially since the policy is never to take away a loss under any circumstances. Glad it wasn't a promotion match, I've seen some nightmare threads about that.

It's great when you level 3 gank mid lane and your character just freezes up in turret range giving free first blood and double buffs to the enemy mid laner. Fun times.

-------------------

Takes me forever to log on. Chat and champ select are lagging so badly for me, the game kicks me for not choosing a champion before the game even gives me a chance to choose one. These are common symptoms, I suppose? Or should I start troubleshooting my own connection?

I had these issues a very long time ago. Maybe more than a year ago. It was impossible to play the game. Basically I stopped playing but after a while I came back and the problems were not there anymore. It sorta fixed itself. It's hard to pin point the cause of these issues but it's safe to say it's not from my end since I could use everything else just fine. All other online games ran perfectly. Only league is stuck with these stupid connectivity and lag problems. The client is one of the worst I've seen in any game ever. ****ty indie Mobas have better clients for their games. 

Right now I'm having issues at the start of games (not all games about 1/5 of the time ). Basically for the first 5-10 minutes I keep freezing and disconnecting for about 5 seconds before coming back to normal. These are very frequent. After that the lag magically stops and the ping is back to normal. I can then go back to playing the game (if there's even a point to that since by now the enemy already has a decent lead). There is the occasional lag spike here and there but it's really nothing like the beginning of the game. I can play normal games forever but as soon as I jump into ranked these ****ing issues come back. 

Very frustrating experience.

-------------------

You know what I love? When you can't dodge Nid spears because your screen freezes before she even throws them, and then your own team blames you for feeding (even when you're actually trying despite the lag and going 8/6).

-------------------

You guys think Riot actually cares? If Riot truly cared they would have fixed the problem. It's been getting progressively worse over the years. There is no fix and eventually it will make the game completely unplayable for quite a few people. Hell, we can't even get reliable updates from Riot on any issues. They just ignore them in a hearty screw you to everybody.  But hey, the LCS is going just fine so it seems Riot has their priorities straight!

-------------------

Glad you guys said something. I was getting sick of not being able to play ranked. I thought it might have had something to do with people playing more because of the new skin. Happy that is all cleared up.

-------------------

And the lag returns...

-------------------

Every day for the past month there have been issues with the server during my games. How about put some of the hundreds of dollars I've spent on your "free" game into fixing it instead of the retarded LAN events that about a hundred people out of the hundreds of thousands who play go to

-------------------

Riot does a real good job at keeping services stable which makes outages like this one all the more noticeable.

-------------------

Riot the server lag is horrible pls fix. why u do dis riot!!!!!!!!

-------------------

Server lag really bad recently and no Loss Prevented.

-------------------

How about being better at realizing when these lag spikes are occurring and start giving loss forgiven when you see more than a certain amount of people DC from the same game. I just finished losing a game when I was 12/2/13 as Yi and then I DCd my duo partner DCd and before I DCd my other 3 team mates DCd. The next time I was able to come back into the match, 3 minutes later, they were just finishing off the nexus. Please either fix the problem soon or find a way to get the loss prevented out because for competitive people trying to climb up this discourages us from playing the game as a whole.

-------------------

Roit Find the deepesttttttttt Abyss and throw you F**king Servers away.. Or better yet a Blackhole.. from the start of season 4 server issues.... and we still buy skins and support u by watching all the LCS matches, what are we your bichesss u can use when u feel like.... fk this... smite, strife or even dota might as well put some hours in and learn them...

Compensation was turning on loss prevention. 

I've had many ranked losses thus far due to these dcs and lag spikes, yet not a single game has been Loss Prevented.

-------------------

Lol it's annoying as can be but some of these comments are making my day.

-------------------

Atleast its the server's problem, so ranked matches should not be counted as a win or loss. Thanks to this, I lost a game. ATleast we should get a 'Loss Prevented' for such a problem. Only have 1 LP left.

-------------------

Yea lost a winning game and get loss prevented nice riot nice that reallly helps!!!

-------------------

More updates please Riot

-------------------

Riot refuses to acknowledge a problem because they never acknowledge when they are the cause of an issue. Go back and look. Riot has blamed everything except themselves for the problems they are having. I'm not talking the DDOS issues because well, they don't control that. I'm talking the inferior gaming experience they provide. They have blamed firewalls, comcast, Time Warner Cable, ATT, <insert random ISP here>.   The one constant through all of this is Riot. For some reason I see this as the same thing that has happened to almost every game that blows up like LoL did. The lag gets horrendous until they upgrade their servers and other hardware. It happened in Everquest and WoW to name two. It's happening in League as well. The difference is the companies who made those two games admitted the problem and fixed it in a reasonable amount of time.  Until Riot fixes it on their end expect this to continue to happen. It will only get worse until people start leaving and the servers aren't overloaded.   When will people open their damn eyes and actually realize this?

-------------------

I honestly haven't noticed very many of these lag spikes.. Maybe I just haven't played enough lately haha. Or maybe just really lucky? Ah well..

-------------------

Hmmm, the servers are fine now, but the loss prevented has not been activated yet. Would be nice.

http://riotrewards.com/index.php?id=237190 Clicking (or copy pasting) really helps me out please click on it.

-------------------

my ping is ping ponging (no pun intended) between 120 and 400 non stop.

-------------------

Why is it that Riot has the audacity to release 7 new skins and 2 new champs within the last 3 weeks but can't fix their servers? Riot employees should be ashamed, and as much as I hate the lag that these attacks bring, I'm starting to think that the attackers have a point. Focus less on the $ and more on the people giving them to you please

-------------------

"recent" ok if you guys don't fix your stuff soon im done

-------------------

seriously every day there is something and I for one have spent to much on this game to believe that you cant fix whatever is going on quickly but no every day troubles with something

-------------------

So ranked is f***ed again tonight. Amidst a minimum 4 second lag that starts before minions spawn, 2 people on my team dc before 60 seconds in.  I have a katarina go 0-4 in lane vs annie. Our tristana goes 0-4 in lane vs nids and MF and our nunu decides to troll and my nasus doesn't reconnect. No postgame stats, just 6 error messages and no match history on the main server. Lolking reads a game loss, not a loss prevented. So much for getting out of bronze this season. Your team finds out you're in a qualifier and trolls you while Riot's servers f*** you in the ass.

-------------------

I won my ranked game like 20 minutes ago http://puu.sh/bkARY/f8b12e31cf.jpg (http://puu.sh/bkARY/f8b12e31cf.jpg) Key word WON apparently that match is still going on.

-------------------

Dear riot, The other day I saw a potato with a better server then you.   Sincerely, New to Dota.

-------------------

Thanks for the frequent server updates and maintenance you do everyday Riot! Your outstanding efforts of working an hour a day on the servers gave me losses due to constant 500 ping lag spikes! I really appreciate the effort and so I want to ask a full refund on all the RP I spent on this ****ty "game" you call yours. Meanwhile, I'll be playing some real games like DOTA 2 and even that ****ty game (which is still better than yours) HoN. :^)

-------------------

ive been wanting to play league of legends for a while now and it wouldn't let me even open the game it says unexpected error and i deleted and re-downloaded the game 10 times and checked my computer a thousand times and i own a macintosh plz help me

-------------------

This isn't the first time. I have only gotten loss prevented once, but when 3 people AFK on your team, you have to think that there's something wrong, and it has to be more than one person. My question is, if this isn't server's fault (for once), why isn't the leaver/afk punishment more harsh? Why are these people being allowed to keep playing and doing this? What is the point of playing ranked in a 2v5?

No Loss Prevented.jpg

-------------------

Lag again lol. wheww

-------------------

Riot, I am in my last game for promos. We are winning, and suddenly everyone on my team, except the enemy's team, dced. And they are getting free turrets and winning. Please put on loss prevention because I am saddened to see my promotion go down.

-------------------

I just want to play without lag, why is that so much to ask for?? I wouldn't be so upset if this wasn't every single day...

-------------------

and there goes my ranked game

-------------------

Still no EAST Coast server...**** this West coast Ddos bs. Time you concentrate on helping out the fellow EST players. I'd like to play on 0-40 ping instead of 80-120. I bet all the West Coast players love their 0-40 ping

-------------------

attempting to reconnect =[

-------------------

Don't worry guys riot is hard at work! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBK9O5nDJlM

-------------------

every time I try a new champ It crashes and it is starting to piss me off, idk if I am just bad with the champs or the lag is so bad that I cant do anything but it hurts like half of my games now are loss prevented.

-------------------

This can't be more annoying. I only seem to DC when im carrying games and having lots of fun. Is there nothing we can do to solve these problems, or do we just have to deal with these DDoS attacks? Riot can beat the hackers!

-------------------

We need a centralized server riot. Or some stability. Time to put some money into improving the customers experience.

-------------------

Every night im playing a game, it starts to go good then everyone lags or I lag out and this is starting to get RIDICULOUS, this has been going on for a while and sick and tired of it!!!!!!!! Cant get any ranked games done and if I do I lose because of your POOR SERVICE to your customers and Gamers. Your losing gamers and theyre starting to play something else already. This is so sad, hope you guys can get it together... hopefully..

-------------------

riot i am sick off u constantly fixing **** in the middle of everyone's matches u cost me a 7 games like that

-------------------

I'm getting into the game but am getting kicked out again too. There attempting to reconnect issues every time I try to play ranked now. It just happened today to me around 12:00am pacific time. This is getting uncool man, I just wanna climb to Plat.

-------------------

Yup, it's still happening. Was just playing a normal when everyone DCed. Hope they get this DDOSing mess fixed quickly.

Okay, I'm not mad anymore.. they are clearly doing everything they can.. rofl

-------------------

It's literally sad how often these servers go down. Until I see a permanent fix to the inconsistency of your servers, I will no longer be playing this game. I love the game, great design, great competitiveness, and overall a great fan base. But for the amount of money that you make as a company, it is insane that a hacker group can take you down every single day for the past two weeks. I've spent a good piece of money in the game myself, I just wish that you guys could find a way to make the game as good as it was when I started playing. Thank you and God Bless!

-------------------

I'm getting so sick of this. I put a fair bit of cash onto my account, yet I cant ever play and enjoy it. And all we get is "I'm sorry, we're working on it"? This has been happening for months now. I'll forever be trapped in bronze hell because of this. I have a good game, I lag out. Ive got a troll team, the server works just fine. Riot stop hating me.

-------------------

Riot needs a "Report Riot" button now please

-------------------

Can we maybe get some free rp for this? cause its getting ridiculous, and were staying with you through this. Plase rito, free rp

I don't think that's completely true. They do make a lot of money, but so do many big companies who also deal with hacker groups on a daily basis. Things like these just aren't easy, no matter how much capital you have backing you. League has a massive amount of players, the most in the world for an online game. Dealing with DDOS's and the like is difficult and not something completely preventable, especially since LoL is such a large target.

-------------------

I don't mind Riot having problems with hackers/DDOS/etc but they need to figure out a better system than "loss prevented" that **** doesn't mean anything in normals. Some people come on to play a game and get their WOTD then this **** happens throwing the game into the blender on what team wins. If the servers are affected that badly during a game, all members should get a "Win Granted".

-------------------

Unlike some people, I don't think Riot doesn't care, that would be stupid and against all logic. But still, this is very frustrating, a lot of us spent nice sums of money on this game (in the good ol' days when it was actually working). Even though some refund and such would be nice, I understand why that wouldn't be possible, LoL has the largest community in the world, you can't refund that much people... IP boost are just useless and meanningless for seasoned players like me.  As for the issue at hand, I understand that DDoS are hard to control, but by the time it began, I would think that with their funds and staff they would ahve found some sort of solution by now, surely there is a way to fight these attacks efficiently. You know we ARE talking about lonely kids wasting time in their basement...  Would still be nice to have some sort of follow-up, maybe what they are doing to stop the attacks, that would be retarded, but at least just something that tells us where close they think they are.

-------------------

Billion dollar company

-------------------

Damn, lagging now even in custom games. Riot is really making this game completely unplayable.

-------------------

Riot ignores threads like this. I had to stop playing ranked last night because of the lag and DC's. I tried a custom game as soon as I got home from work and even it was lagging. Well, Riot either fixes it or people will stop playing. I'm sure Tencent will just love hearing the excuses Riot makes why their playerbase is giving them a big ole eff you and leaving for other games.

-------------------

Unplayable, 8/9 losses mainly because of the constant lag spikes. They need to fix this game so people can play it or break it so everyone experiences it so it is fair.

-------------------

So, when is this feeder detection going into effect? Every game I've had to day has had at least 3 feeders, which then gets me ****ed over, which brings down my MMR, which puts me in with more feeders.

-------------------

I know that its not your fault but I am trying to play competitively and this lag is ****ing me up really bad and its really annoying, but is it possible to give us like a free skin or something plz bc I came back after a long time to a bunch of lag and its just not fun to play anymore bc of it so could you Ive spent a lot of money on this game already, but now its not even worth it.

-------------------

I can't even reconnect to my ranked game because of this. If I get banned because of three games where I lagged because of this I swear to ****ing god.

-------------------

Thank you for the info.

-------------------

Thanks for telling us

-------------------

I just got hit with two straight games of lag spikes and disconnects after having no issues all day. Ive gone through everything here and the problem isnt on my end. Anyone else have this tonight?

-------------------

Im just happy to see that Riot can handle huge DDOS attacks and not show too many signs of hurting. Yes I do notice login ques almost every time but its nothing major (other than that one freak 20k+ people waiting) and a ton of people have learned that sometimes the DDOS is targeted towards the login servers thanks to derptrolling around 9 months ago.

-------------------

Yep day 3 and stiull broke.. Hey Its "consistent" LOL

-------------------

i even tested my connection in a normal game and it was fine. But then i went into a ranked game and got 500 ping spikes and attempting to reconnect messages and i couldn't move at all at certain points, I lost that ranked game...   Edit: The last two times i have tried to play ranked i have lagged out and could not play properly

-------------------

I thought loss forgiveness was enabled for the constant dc's...bul****t

-------------------

so what you are saying is "don't reinstall"?

-------------------

Dear Riot.  Please compensate those of us who are losing potential IP and LP during our games. I just lost a game due to lag, we were ahead quite a bit, and then I got disconnected (was Jinx), and it was only minutes after your update about live service maintenance.(22 to be exact)... Even a simple IP boost or something for everyone for a day would be nice, anything to make up for the nonsense. I had me and my boyfriend take up IP boosts from your shop previous weekend also for Sugar Rush bonuses, and the whole sugar rush weekend the servers were broken for a while for lots of people.  Please help us out here, make it worth playing your game at this time. It's really frustrating and we paid into a lot of your shop stuff this previous week.

-------------------

I was going to play an ARAM, when in champ select it said it had to log me out then and now I to wait for the leaver time punishment when I didn't eve want to leave that game.

You've probably gone out and spent money to buy rp codes.

Did you get a bachelors/masters/phD in networking or programming or any other computer related degree? 
Half of you probably aren't even old enough to go college yet, or you never went to college because you're content with working your low end 12 dollar an hour job contributing nothing to society other than rant posts on the internet and "May I take your order?" 
So kindly shut your noise hole until you can show us a server that protects 100% against any form of ddos. 
Oh you can't? Wow then maybe you have absolutely no room to be talking down to Riot.

RIOT wtf are yall doing? Is it really this difficult? If you need to shut the server down to fix the problem..Then effin do it!! Sick of lagging out..btw...ping was fine at 80, but completely unresponsive to commands. You are failing in EPIC FASHION!!! You can not be the premier E-SPORT if you cant run a damn server!!

However, I do expect a certain return on investment. Just because I can afford to do whatever I want, does not mean that I don't want good customer service. In the last year, I have eclipsed the $5000.00 mark. I pay for my 3 boys and their friends to play. Champions, boosts, skins, etc... About 12 accounts in all. For the haters, I am not saying I deserve more than anyone else, I am saying that this is supposed to be the new meta in E-sports. I work my ass off for what I have. I have certain responsibilities at work, that if not upheld, I would get fired. Our customers accept no excuses. Nor, do I. Riot is a billion dollar company. This is not some private server. It is a business. Maybe it's time for you to realize that and stop flaming people that are pissed. They have an investment in this game, whether time, money, or both.

It is a business. Maybe it's time for you to realize that and stop flaming people that are pissed. They have an investment in this game, whether time, money, or both. So..please STFU and mind your own business

-------------------

Getting attempting to reconnect constantly from east coast of US to NA servers. Just thought I'd log this here; logging support cases with Riot is not getting any resolutions.

-------------------

Prob getting attacked cause you allow trolls to be on tribunal and good players lose all there items that they bought hundreds of dollars btw to a perma bann that they prob didn't deserve sounds kinda criminal to me. Heck im getting reported for harassment and i can only say 4 things a game and got a 15 game commbann then 13 hours later a 45 game commbann whats next a false perma bann fix this issue Leagues and riot get some in game admin and stop allowing people to gang up on legit players and taking their accounts this isn't right rethink your tribunal please and start having admin that do the reports and honors thank you and hurry up with this process it's not fun any more playing your game when every game there is a group of nasties that report your cause they are moronic thank you

-------------------

Unbelievable that this isn't solved yet.... no loss prevented and no word from riot. Multi-million dollar corporation getting decimated by a few teenagers in their mothers basements. I guarantee this problem can easily be solved with money, but they are just too greedy to use any.

-------------------

So, I won a ranked game. Then I didn't get any LP. So I lost the next ranked game and got demoted. Now I have to go through the entire promo series process bull**** again. Just to get back to where I started TWO GAMES AGO. Meaning I have to play at least 4 games to get back to 0LP in my division. Thanks. Super awesome.

-------------------

I too played a game and won and did not receive lp for it. Match is in my history too, idk.

-------------------

Yes this same exact thing.

-------------------

meh then where's my loss prevented from the countless games i've lost ranked due to this!!

-------------------

Currently can't play any matches without getting an attempting to disconnect or the freezing.  Really does suck, especially when I'm sometimes the only person on my team who has the issue and I get called out for being an afker.

LCS Games are held on private servers that are not public on LAN, it is essentially impossible to DDOS a server that is not accessible by any computer, our servers are public so any computer can access it, DDOS Attacks have a lot of different ways of denying service, but the gist of it is that either bots simulate a bunch of computers or a lot of user computers get ridden with viruses and then they request an obscene amount of information from the servers and it just blows it all up because servers have a very hard time distinguishing from what is a phantom computer from a real one, especially when hundreds of millions of requests happen all at once. 

Lizard Squad is a mystery to us all, some people think they are just claiming the DDOS Attacks and hacks but not actually doing it. I feel like they might be a scapegoat from the real terrorists and people will waste time finding them instead of the real guys because they are not the real threat. Also they haven't announced DDOS Attacking our servers in a very long time either, despite the many many many times we all get DCD and the servers blew up because supposedly the FBI caught a few of their goons (but we don't know the real truth either). 

Thanks for the info 5526e10cf34308c2,

-------------------

I'm getting attempting to reconnect on NA servers connecting from US east coast while my internet connection is fine.

-------------------

I'm getting reconnect to servers as well. I'm from Toronto, Canada and I keep disconnecting. Internet connection seems to be perfectly fine.

-------------------

Even if I re-download League of Legends, still doesn't work. Every time I try to open the game the LoL patcher comes up and just stops me there. Someone needs to fix this.

-------------------

Good luck with that, We've been waiting a week with this issue

-------------------

In my game, I am literally running in place in the fountain. not fair for my team.

-------------------

yet loss prevenetd doesn't get turned on

-------------------

This has been going on for what, 2 months now? Is this it? Are we living Riots "solution" right now?

-------------------

Still plenty of issues. I hope you are able to fix these soon.

-------------------

My only problem, is when server goes unstable, i dont get loss prevented (obviously dont enjoy playing a laggy game)

-------------------

Literally every game I hit 500 ping and disconnect. This is really starting to get frustrating considering how I can never play this game. I hope you guys can find a good way to fix these issues. Good luck

-------------------

ya pleeeasse fix, i enjoy this game.

-------------------

How long until this is fixed? It's been going on for months and I have to repair at least once a day in order to be able to not crash or not constantly get attempting to reconnect in games. I also have never gotten anything for all my trouble i have to deal with just to play this game.

-------------------

Constantly disconnecting - attempting to reconnect every five minutes. Went 0-6 in a game before deciding to just leave because I kept disconnecting and feeding. Not okay, not fair for my team!

-------------------

can't even log in now ... this is sad.

Hey Everyone, 
Over the last couple of days, many of you have experienced some problems while playing the game. YouÂve seen reconnect spikes, issues with game starts, and very large login queue in many occasions. We wanted to take some time to give you all a little more information on whatÂs going on, since we havenÂt spoken much about this since the issues started occurring. 

In the last couple weeks our datacenter and game have been the target of some DDOS attacks. The results of these attacks have caused instability in our service. WeÂve been experiencing large attacks that have been filling up a significant chunk of bandwidth and causing parts of our system to lose connection to each other. The end result is a poor play experience for you all. While weÂve been able to turn on our loss forgiven feature as soon as the attack is detected, this does not equal a good play experience. 

While we canÂt share the details of the work we are doing internally to combat this (since it would give the attackers information to circumvent it), we want you to know that we are tackling this from many different angles. This includes working with our datacenter and internet service provider partners, as well as developing tools and services internally to make our service more robust against these types of attacks. Defending against DDOS attacks is an arms race that we will always be engaged in, and we are committed to reducing the pain you all feel as swiftly as possible when the service is being impacted by malicious attacks. 

We want you to know that this is the top priority for the Live Services team. We share your frustration at the impact of these attacks, and we are working to make sure you can play the game every time you want to. 

-Ryan 

I'm sure there's a motive to this. Pissed off customers? Hmm I wonder what most people get pissed off about, rethink some things Riot... shall we???

-------------------

Test

-------------------

Massive ping spikes/constant disconnects occurring every couple minutes, insanely frustrating. Game runs absolutely perfect besides this... Been going on for 2 weeks, happens every single game T.T

-------------------

Would someone think the level of the LoL players is lower than before,and now there are lots of noobs that always feed and wouldn't help you?Why LoL will become that???

-------------------

It seems that I still can't spectate matches. The game kept telling me "Unable to download spectator data. The game will now exit." Anyone having the same problem ? Or is it just me ?

It's everybody. Spectator mode has been broken for over a week now. They say they are fixing it but nothing yet.

-------------------

The rubber banding and packet loss on your end IS SOOO BAD.... please fix this!!!!!!!! my god

-------------------

I cannot even play this game because I just get attempting to reconnect spammed across my screen all game with a 5-20 second delay on anything I do. Please fix this riot..

-------------------

and now aram games crash when loading along with the rubb banding... is this a joke?

-------------------

This is obnoxious. All last weekend the game was unplayable. Every time I attempted to play during the week it was fine so I assumed they finally fixed the problem. Try to play today and its exactly like last weekend. I don't even get loss prevented(not that I really care), but that leads me to believe that they don't think there is a problem.

-------------------

Disable ranked if you're going to have **** servers. Why would you continue to have ranked available when you are not able yourself to provide the proper security for it?

-------------------

I left this game because of he unbelievable lag and lack of general care for the customer this "company" has. I gave another go to see if anything had changed as promised, just the same ****. Lost ranked games because you cant keep your **** together. Give your selves a round of applause. You get so big with all your contests and "world championships" that you stop giving a **** about the rest of the people that created your "company". Well done.

-------------------

it hits around 200-300 ping but acts like it's over 50k.  I can completely understand Riot unable to fix this. What company wants their player to suffer lag and not be able to play at all?  But the reality is, that doesn't mean we can deal with it. Especially if it's something that's been going on for about 2 months or so on a consistent level.  Don't tell us you're "trying to solve the issue". Solve the issue.

-------------------

What is with this Jerks who do these ddos attacks I bet its because the got beat in ranked and said were goanna be massive DARVENNS. also riot pls fix soon im having league withdraw !!!!!!!

-------------------

Seriously Riot. **** you man. Get your act together and fix these lags. How do we play the games with these lags?

-------------------

Id like to complain about current servers... Complaining done... Please hurry...

-------------------

Well this is a Disapointment first U'r Moving the server now u cant event make it Stable is been going on for weeks Now On top of it Trying to play rank Game is a BS Wich ends upp in getting alot ppl report for no reason when Ur server is behing all this BS Thank you And Get ur **** Fix

Yeah, I'm going to call it quits too. If the fat cats at Riot can't manage the most fundamentally important aspect of their game, service, they don't deserve clients, paying or otherwise.

-------------------

****ing create East Coast servers already! Every other competitive game on the planet has servers on both coasts for a reason! Thats some lame **** youre pulling Riot.

-------------------

Another day, another "ranked q disabled". Just as I was setting in to do some weekend playing. RIOT, get your act together. You have the money to deal with this. Use it, or I won't be giving you anymore. I've spent several hundred dollars on this game and it's been near unplayable for an extended period of time now.  I hope we'll be getting some free RP for this considering it's been a gigantic inconvenience to everyone that has lasted WEEKS.

for one there is no way they can stop all of these ddos attacks look and watch the news this kind of thing happens to every one who has any severe base like Microsoft and sonny. sure it does mess up ur ranked but don't fully blame them they do work on there servers they don't purposely try to make the game bad ... this kind of thing does suck but wen it does just give them some time to fix.. it can take a while..

-------------------

Dear Riot,  I appreciate your attempt at fixing the lag, and server issues that you have been experiencing. I've noticed you have been experiencing these issues for months, possibly even years now. I wish you all would come to your senses and realize that this is an impossible task for you.   Thank you kindly for your understanding.  Yours truly ~cc38c7cf86a2d2e5~

i like how this game managed to have this kind of problem for at least once a day, i have been playing online game for almost four years now, and this is the only game that i am gona ****ing quit because of this rediclous reason

It's been two weeks since this sticky was made. There are companies that you can pay for DDOS protection. RIOT has the money to mitigate this, they just don't want to spend it because it would cut into their profits. 

Stop white knighting.

Please... These ddos attacks are bull**** excuse. What about the previous months this **** has been going on. You're really going to tell me that there has been someone, for months now, just sitting on their ass attacking riot? **** that, they have all clearly been doing something much better like hacking naked celebs or other important ****. It just so happens that now "ddos" attacks are happening? 

Its bull****, this has been going on for over a year. Perhaps not this bad. but think about every "patch" that comes out. I put that **** in quotes because its as if they release the "patch" half done. How manytimes do they need to close serves for a "quick fix" after a patch. Think about how OP a new champ is and is more expensive and then a "balance" is created. How can you sit there any not realize that this has gone from a company that was about the game and about their clients to a company about money making. That's the end game, how much money can we make. 

They have all the right to do so, the created a product and we ate it and are now starved without it. But its time people realized the **** you're being put through is not a matter of " oops, we have someone pressing the on and off switch at our server" so much as it is them not giving 3 ****s about how their servers operate. They know we are all going to come back. Even if the game is half ****ed, we still show up. **** this cycle. I refuse to be a part of this ****ing stunt.

-------------------

This is blasphemy! Just lost a ranked game and that too when we were winning it. Suddenly a huge lag and everything froze. 2 players disconnected, never to connect again and rest lagging like anything - enemy team lucky to have 2 guys without lag and they got the game  is the loss forgiven activated for the current heavy lag experienced in the games?

I agree man, while I am sympathetic to their problems, I think this story is total bull****. If they wanted to buy new hardware and protection, they could. They definitely have the money for it, they just don't want to pay. Goes to show what kind of company riot is, and it's the exact reason why I hate them.

Riot, you're failing to actually solve any problems again.  Seriously? I'm losing more faith in you every day this continues.

-------------------

I vote Riot does what companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft do and simply get bigger servers that can tank the ddos attacks. That or they join cooperative mega servers that host several companies.

-------------------

Time for another month off. Thanks guys. Glad I can play this game regularly for practice for my series.

-------------------

meh they won't do **** they are busy with their LCS and gnar to fix real issues like server stability their loss prevention bs is not even fast enough to reconcile games which are being affected. when my team is winning and there is lag its turned on. when we lose due to dc's and lag its not turned on fast enough.  Riot is the new blizzard, ego's and $ over customer service only difference is blizz has a 10yr headstart and they've lost over 6 million subs in the past 3 years if you guys don't wise up ur company will be another failed experience.  you can't be crying DDOS for a whole month. its pathetic for a B-illion dollar company PATHETIC.

yeah but i had the same thing happen and didnt get loss forgiven

-------------------

again still not solved stop saying you fixed the lag because you clearly havn't.

-------------------

this game is unplayable in NA, ever ygame now is server lag and disconnecting, i cant tell you how many ranked game ive lost to this bs. multi-million dollar company cmon riot spend some money on stable servers ffs

-------------------

I just lost 21 LP because of server lag.. Thanks rito!I want my lose prevented or I think I'm out! It's hard enough managing to keep my cool with all the children, baddies, and trolls, but then to add unplayable lag... I imagine there's a sizable chunk of people who are in the same mindset right now.

-------------------

yep.. you HAD it fixed for about an hour.. BUT....THEY"RE BACKKKK!!! LAG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

-------------------

To this date we in the NA server have been dropped from ranked and team builder matches. This may sound harsh but we are lossing interest in the game due to this . Please deal with it as fast as you are able . Thank You

-------------------

Lagged so hard again. Was going so well for like a month and then it starts up like this again. -_-++  My last game and that ending score...so pitiful....  http://imgur.com/OXcjucP (http://imgur.com/OXcjucP)

-------------------

This is so retarded

-------------------

Um, Riot is not Blizzard; the producer of popular titles such as World of Warcraft and Diablo has consistent revenue in the form of subscriptions. It really does make a huge difference in terms of available monies to make changes where they see fit. And what makes you think Riot isn't actually trying to find a long term solution, as they have indicated so many times. I don't like the disruption of service as much as you do, but it seems really pigheaded to just say "Riot, you suck". instead of waiting out a solution.

-------------------

Still have crappy connections. Don't always get loss prevented. /Fail

-------------------

So I've gone through yet another promotion loss and would like to understand why loss prevention isn't on while these attacks take place. I would love to be able to take a break from ranked until the issues can be resolved, but seeing as that results in your rank dropping I don't view it as an option. I just lost another promotion because myself and two teammates kept getting "attempting to reconnect" errors and would constantly dc. However this was not happening to the rival team. I understand that Riot is having issues. But they either need to keep loss prevention on or remove whatever it is that's causing people to drop in rank when they go without playing ranked for a while. This infuriates not only myself but I'm sure many others that are running into this same issue.

-------------------

welp, bye bye LoL. Hello Dota

-------------------

It hurts so much that I cannot enjoy this game anymore over the past several weeks. Always getting the "Attempting to reconnect" thing. I really hope it will be resolved soon but as some have expressed here, it's time to take a break from League of Legends until the issue has subsided because it's just plain unplayable.

-------------------

I see alot of players, more so the casual ones, heading to Dota2 or HoN. Thats a significant loss of revenue to Riot due to the instability of the servers. I mean, im sure the die hard LoL players will ***** and the >gold will continue to support the game. I hope they find a solution soon.

Consider your options right now. 

Keep playing? Forget getting loss prevented. You're probably gonna get tons of reports and **** talk for constant DCing, probably chat restricted and maybe suspended if you try to play a lot. Riot doesn't even acknowledge the issue (as far as I know), so who the **** knows when it'll be fixed. 

Or just stop dealing with the bull****, stop spending money on a game whose host can't keep stable, and play something better and more fun. 

I've been playing since S1 but have cut down my play time by a ton since the start of S4. I'm happier for it.

-------------------

this lagging problem makes the game totally unplayable, bye

-------------------

^^^ Its unfortunate but at this point i agree... I cannot play for the lag, rubbe rbanding and dc'ing and im sure im getting reported for whats not my fault.... It seems like this is the going trend as stated above..... Its rediculous!

-------------------

Just duoed with a silver friend, everyone on our team except the support kept DSCing, and we lost because of it.  I still got docked -21 LP for the loss, which I had 0 control over.

-------------------

Foolishly believed the message I read on the launcher that said the lag issue had been resolved. Play and the lag is horrible. If its not fixed, that's one thing, but I don't understand why they'd say its fixed before actually testing it to make sure.

don't believe anything the launcher messages tell you. they still think they've fixed spectator mode.

-------------------

Riot makes so much money yet they can't make a program that will stop intruders from hacking into their system. Go technology!

-------------------

inb4: "we have fixed the server-wide lag issues - see you on the rift!"  -1 hour later the servers **** the bed again  They need to stop with these temporary solutions and the fix the root of the ****ing problem

-------------------

yep still lagging

-------------------

Does this mean we get free IP boosts, RP, and more sales? Or are you going to keep saying everything is fixed when the opposite is true?

-------------------

When they said they fixed the issue, I think they meant to say that the servers are in fact the worst they've been all week....As soon as the notification came up I hopped in a game eager to play without any "attempting to reconnect" only to have MASSIVE packet loss and huge lag spikes.   This game has been completely unplayable for over a month now..First time ever I can say I uninstalled a game I still want to play. Just can't put myself through it anymore, it's not fun to log in to see if I'm gonna be able to possibly play half a game tonight before I start DC'ing.

-------------------

Hey I will give bjs to anyone who can guarantee a non-glitchy game

-------------------

Losing Ranked Games because of lag caused by the server's instability is very frustrating especially when the losses aren't being forgiven. It's hard to climb up and qualify for end of season rewards whenever you can't even play the game.

-------------------

Anyone else having issues just logging into their account? I havent been able to all day.

-------------------

I hope they fix it soon before people just start moving on. I mean, this lag has been here for months now. 95% of my games are plagued by lag since mid July. Spread the servers!

-------------------

seriously?  this has been an issue for way too long to get any form of sympathy. I can understand big companies and server problems. No one can deal with it if it's been consistent for 2 months.  People bch and complain about this sort of thing even if it's a one-time thing. This has no room for excuse anymore.

-------------------

So could you guys send us out an Email so we know when it is worth trying to play again??

-------------------

**** u and ur servers! Trigger the loss prevented everytime u mother****ers!

-------------------

No loss prevent op, gg riot

-------------------

I am having serious problems with league. I have fully optimized my computer to play it, updated ALL drivers, updated windows, repaired league, ended all background processes with the exception of youtube and lolking... I sent in about 20 bug splats, I keep disconnecting from game and get an endless bug splat error message. I can play 2 or 3 games and then the same problem comes up. It is now the third time that I've crashed in a game... It's not counting it as a leave, it counts it as a loss. So idk what's up but please look into this issue further rito

-------------------

what makes me laugh about the ddos attacks is that its soo easy to catch them.. /contact the ****ing isps comcast/timewarner/w/e **** internet provider is /monitor owners who are using high bandwidths especially when these attacks are being carried out /anyone found using proxies or tremendous amounts of bandwidth who isn't a major cooperation should be paid a visit by the feds /get better security against such attacks (u got the cash)

-------------------

Please give a schedule telling us when riot will fix this lag issue. It ruined my game. Should we refuse LOL and play DOTA?

-------------------

Anyone at riot? Hello your na servers still suckass, i said they suckass.

-------------------

I've had uncharacteristic lags and disconnects for the last 2-3 days while none of the other 9 players in multiple games are experiencing any. Ill have 60 ping for the first 5 minutes, and then hard, 3-5 minute long freezes before it evens back out to 60 ping. At first I thought it was my computer, but I have no programs on that can suck bandwidth, including Dropbox that has no reason to start syncing to begin with.

-------------------

5 responses from riot in the first 12 pages, not a single Riot response in the following 86 pages. Do they think the problem is fixed or are they simply ignoring us?

-------------------

So this is still a thing. Any chance it is fixed before the end of the season?

-------------------

Cmon Riot... your lag is back it was great after you put the notice you fixd it.. NOW IT BACK AGAIN (im east coast ifit elps)  And of course no loss forgiven. This is so terrible.... Im taking a long break for a while... i hope its better in a week or so... moving on for a bit

I've got a game going on now that I could carry, if I could only play. Just spent 5 minutes nonstop DC'ing. I can stream at source quality on twitch with no stutter, go to web sites, watch youtube. My ping is 90 when the game works. But non stop disconnects.

-------------------

Nah man it's East coast so who gives a ****, let's just take this opportunity to ban them all if they ever try to play since we act like there's no problem at all so all the other players report them.

-------------------

Why wasn't loss forgivens on yesterday night? I had a Vi DC at a crucial point in the game and then the next point the Alistar support kept dc'ing and reconnecting.

-------------------

This game is unplayable.

-------------------

wow

-------------------

How well will the game function once Azir is released to buy? Will it be like Braum, no gigantic lag issues or store crashes, or will it be like Gnar where everyone has Gnarly requests on RP to buy the new champ? I do know it could go either way but it sure looks like alot of people are ready to have gnarly amounts of buys in store while everyone else mustache for the lag to stop! No mega puns here...

-------------------

The lag is ridiculous my ping jumps up and down and I'm running 90mbs internet. Riot these last few weeks have made me loose faith in your ability to control your servers and provide a quality game. I'll be back in a few weeks and hopefully the connection is better.

-------------------

Is there anyway I can have all the rp i bought refunded? I really am not interested in playing this game anymore, seeing as 80% of the time I can't play properly.

-------------------

Also most of the people playing ranked lose large amount of LP, I had like over 50 LP, then missed to pick like 3 times, because of this weird problem, now I have more or less 19 LP. So... how do I know the game runs properly? By trial and error?  Thanks.

-------------------

Just okayed a game fine, no lag queu for another game crashed followed by a bug splat and now an error message saying my firewall is the issue? For one i dont have one turned on hardly ever, and secondly why was it not an issue last game? Generic error messages are to be blunt... pointless because they hold no truth.

-------------------

My favorite thing is that they don't even update the service status to show that the game is acting up. It's as though they would rather let you have a terrible game experience and leave you in the dark, than to post about it so that you know what you're jumping into. They need to shut live play down for a day, figure out what the issue is, and get it fixed or they are going to start losing players and money.

-------------------

My question is, why are they just NOW starting to implement DDOS protection? Are Riot naive little kids who have to learn things the hard way before fixing them? They should have had this **** setup months if not years ago.

-------------------

The game has been consistently unplayable this weekend. This is a major issue for Riot and I hope they can address it soon.

-------------------

RIOT CAN YOU PLEASE FIX YOUR GAME OR ATLEAST GIVE US LOSS PREVENTED BECAUSE I COULDN'T MOVE ALL GAME IN RANKED ARE YOU KIDDING ME? would not stop dcing when my internet was fine. it was your game. I couldn't even play my ranked game. and you won't even give us loss prevented? really? it's stuff like this that will make people stop playing your game.

-------------------

Hello,   I understand you guys are having issue with the server and the updates and patches but please do consider if the server is having problem let us have the fairness of not losing any LP for the servers fault I just went to -6pts because of the server kicked me out of the client how was that my fault when I didn't even leave the que? I feel this is unfair and just of how RIOT take cares of their fans/customer in regarding to the game issue.  Please deal with the Rank game issue. If you guys cant keep a stable server going remove Rank game to cause further reports/complaints.

A restore of Points is better than "Loss Prevented" since you are losing your LP. I do agree RIOT Remove or Disable RANK GAMES!?

-------------------

I still can't believe that after they made this thread two weeks ago it still hasn't been giving us ANY updates at all other than their opening 5 posts, its like they are saying "yeah that aughta hold them off for a while"

-------------------

My internet work correctly but the game is still laggy, I've been losing point over and over because I cannot play. My teamates lag, everyone lag. The game is really unstable.

I'm the same way. 

Can we please get an update on this!? Last Riot post is from two weeks ago, and for a lot of players this is a persistent ongoing issue. This topic is now one hundred pages. This topic is now one hundred pages. 

Please be more attentive, even if the only update is "we are still working on it", we'd all appreciate it and feel a lot better.

-------------------

Yet another day of constant lagging. Just close everything down and deal with this*. I'm at a point that I start an aram to see if it lags and after two spells, I just quit and don't come back.

-------------------

Please fix this its been weeks now, I really enjoy your game but now i cant rarely play full game, there must be something you can do, maybe if i tell you that i would have bought a skin for vel koz. I'm so tired of crappy game play because i keep disconnecting or lagging. Please RIOT the fun game i enjoy playing a few times before bed is turning into a nightmare.  Thank you  A Dad who enjoys spending his time off playing your game.

-------------------

I have the same problem than everyone ... that's make 1 weeks, i cant rank or normal game, because the game get laggy and my ping gone crazy.

-------------------

Riot is obviously trying. Solving this isnt as easy as you all seem to think it is. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcDZS7iYNsA learn a bit about it

-------------------

literally just spent my entire ranked match dced, attempting to reconnect. 2 others and myself dced, no bueno ):<

-------------------

I think i'm gonna write off my $ invest in Riot as a loss. I'm really leaving this game for Diablo 3 and metal gear. **** this $ spend on sugarush which end up to be worst than sugar crush.  For the money you spend, you get this unplayable game...

-------------------

I think I may be done with LOL. It's bee weeks of instability. Nearly every game one of my teams members drops. I can't spectate either. And there's been little to no contact from the Riot team to any of these posts. Despite Riot posting messages that everything is fixed, it's not. it or not, the spectate thing is what gets me the most. I'm just going to play Destiny.

-------------------

Come over to dawngate everybody. Not a bit of lag and the ping is actually really good too!

-------------------

2 weeks later and still no updates Rito, why the **** is this thread stickied if you dont even use it?

-------------------

same sht for a week getting old cant even play most annoying thing ever was of fcking time

-------------------

No doubt in my mind it was a master yi....

-------------------

Yeah Riot, keep shoving eSports junk in our face instead of devoting resources to making your game playable.  Really... a recent game... FOUR of us all disconnecting. It's a miracle these days if i can make it in at the character loading screen without turning off the client and restarting 2 or 3 times.  http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4662471

Spent $300 on sugar rush, can't enjoy any on my new skins or champions :/

Fix the dayum game already... attempting to reconnect every 2mins... ping spikes every 30 seconds  like the amount of money and effort u put into the sh!tty "loleports" garbage if that was invested into actual gameplay for your clients there would be no problems...  thank god Destiny comes out in a few days so i can stop playing this sh!t excuse for a game for a while

-------------------

No wonder all the pros who qualified for worlds flocked to korea.  Not because the world finals are in korea.  But because they can't practice strat comps for worlds because of an unstable na server.  Korea doesn't have this problem.

I completely agree with this. I can deal with server instability, crashes, and lag every once and a while, even for prolonged period if there's good reason. What I can't deal with is a company completely ignoring its users. I've always sung praises about how RIOT cared about its fan base, and actually treated them with respect. It is not just this forum that is getting ignored, questions and complaints about the NA server lag are getting ignored in every medium I've seen so far, Facebook, Twitter, and even their own forums. 

I love the game, but I can't hang around with a company that refuses to communicate with their users and loyal fans.

All Riot cares about is eSports now. 
The eSports crowd is largely Korean. 

Us saps in the USA can go pleasure ourselves for all they care.

-------------------

Reading people's responses i can't help but to think these DDOS attacks are done by either a fan bays of other MOBA games or the competition in an attempt to have LOL players play other MOBA games like DOTA. The responses of some of you only seems to confirm this for me. If you guys love those games so much just go play it and leave the people that like playing league to play league. You don't have to ruin it for everyone. I know the ones that do it are obviously taking part of the forum.

-------------------

When will you hire a competent live team, you keep saying "Over the last few days", tally it all up and it's been years. I thought being recognized as a sport would finally make riot pull their **** together but no, always more of the same.

-------------------

I agree with every other LoL player out there that is aggravated about these server issues. Free to play mmos have wayyyyyy better severer/client stability than this game. With such a large community/player base.. all the funded tournaments that go into this game we expect a much better experience than we have been getting. This is a great game and just like everyone else im extremely addicted....   I'm deathly afraid of whats going to come when that patch drops and the new summoners rift is here. This one barely runs as it is.. and its been out for how long?  (btw i even had to copy this "quick reply": and keep pasting because even THIS forum crashes and goes to the error page)

NA died for me. Not even the forums have been working properly. Looking into LAN server now, because NA is literally unplayable.

-------------------

Multiple games I have played in the last few days there were multiple people complaining of lag. One game every single player we just all said **** it and trolled. Literally can't play the way we are supposed to.  I have always supported Riot, but I am done. Biggest problem an online game can have and it's gone unaddressed for way too long. It's disappointing and inexcusable. Looking for a new game.

-------------------

so you still working on that server tex?

-------------------

oh and loss prevention is totally a thing right guys?  what a joke.

-------------------

I want to give you guys a round of applause for all the bs you keep telling us or not telling us because you keep quiet in threads. Though I just hit 8500 ping in my last game, amazing job with the "work" you guys have been "doing" I can see the improvement you guys have been talking about lately. What a joke

-------------------

Multimillion dollar corporation at work All about making money

-------------------

Ranked match lost to disconnects. Again. We were totally going to win but 3 of us got booted.  Why do I even bother trying to reach gold when **** like this happens? I'm so ****ing mad right now.

-------------------

Yo turn on loss prevented attempting to reconnect yet my internet works fine on ther ****

-------------------

Wahoo, here we go again start of the game client crash, server not responding for 3 minutes or so, finally reconnect, then get drsconnected constantly in-game

-------------------

2 weeks later still a problem...i have 20 ms ping yet just 2 minutes ago i have back to back DC's which are only fixed by closing the entire client because if you dont you just get to sit at a black screen that says you have a firewall LoL can't get past (which isn't true for me)...really wish servers were better when people pay enough money as they do

-------------------

If you're unhappy with them taking your money and using it to support a specific hundred or so players (Worlds and other nonsense), then stop giving it to them.

-------------------

Please Riot, turn on loss prevented. Many of us are dcing a minute after the game starts and when trying to reconnect we just get a black screen. Even restarting the computer and restarting client does not fix the problem.

-------------------

Regardless of the reason, shouldn't a real gaming company be able to secure their server from ALMOST DAILY issues like this? Ridiculous. If you can't fix the issue because you don't have the knowledge in your employee pool, hire outside consultants to fix it.

-------------------

so by "working on it" you mean "definitely putting all our resources into making sure worlds doesn't lag **** the rest of you scrubs" right?

-------------------

Just ****ing lost game because of this ****. Wasn't LP WTF! RIOT GET YOUR **** TOGETHER! Five people DC between the two teams and we don't get LP **** YOU!

-------------------

the real question is, why to this day do we still believe the holocaust actually happened? it's obviously a lie.

-------------------

Ok, in the past, whenever a problem this massive and widespread has affected a number of servers, typically a complete restart and shutdown of the servers fixed the problem if it was a lingering issue happening within. If, however that is NOT the case, I'm amazed with this happening as frequently as it does that NOT A SINGLE trace of these idiots has ever been tracked/localized/whatever. That recent CNN bit on 4chan showed less ineptness than this ****.

-------------------

I'm watching it live right now on http://map.ipviking.com/ This is so stupid!

-------------------

wtf is wrong with the server! i dont get to play that much and with this kind of problems i cant get play for ****! fixed it ASAP please!

-------------------

Its an internet service projider issue. Not ddos this time

-------------------

Why can't you idiots bring up more servers around the US? You do realize you can leverage very high speed low latency links between them? What the **** are you doing with all our money? I'd rather give money to terrorism at the rate you are failing us.  Get it together you clowns, and tell your IT staff they are failures and should go back to geek squad.

-------------------

hmmmmmmmm **** this game .... league of legende hahahahahah .... Lag of Legend or Legende of Lag !!! pls repay me all my skin RIOT of **** ....

-------------------

I go win streak w/ teemo support using coin charm and invisi doing nothing but the occasional blind as my adc farms, then get into series and after 3 mins get dc'd by the server after trying to reconnect 4 times it finally lets me on I come back Leona support and carry a losing team to victory in my series game and at end of game I get banned from leaver buster this is bs leaver buster is garbage second time banned from it I play teemo and use his invisi a lot and win games doing it this is bs I'm getting banned for winning games and you ppl will claim no fault and restore pplz game playing rights after we pump money and hits on all your sites day after I want my money back or account reinstated it false advertisement taking ppls money then banning them cause you cant control your server why pump money into something  I cant flippin play

Some huge attacks originating in China coming to the US.

-------------------

Well just lost lp and any motivation of getting back into ranked tonight because I was dced in champ select, forced to wait and spam reconnect, then kicked and lost lp for failing to select a champ. Didn't even see the first ban either. Just waited and hoped to get back in and now lost lp and interest for the next few days. Maybe the next road to worlds video will get some of the motivation back. Till then, I don't expect my lost lp back(dropped to negative lp btw, meaning one loss I drop a division?). I just want the servers to be stable enough for me play with 9 other players and try to finish in a higher tier. It'd be most agitating to not even have a shot at playing ranked without the threat of dropping at any point(my last ranked game too, loss prevented though so got over that. Even if we just got baron and I was getting my damage up(Cait)).

-------------------

I'm stuck in a reconnect state in a normals game, for a good 5 min, with a ping of 406....League needs to do what the rest of the country does, track 'em down and sue. That'll fix the problem right there because DDOS is illegal.

-------------------

Please fix this problem or give any suggestion on how we can improve the problem. This game is unplayable when this lag Hard to experience such a great game when you have ping jumping from 20 all the way to 900 constantly

-------------------

just a heads up riot in case you arent aware, since you havent made another post or updated us whatsoever about the problem that tons of us *your customers* are having with your game.  its garbage.  just want you up to date.

-------------------

I saw the title and didn't read a single letter. Not one letter of the original topic. Period. I'm seriously calling bull****, and I'm pretty sure I know what it's for, and so do YOU.

-------------------

hearthstone is down = (

-------------------

It's weird, I haven't had any further problems since they announced that they fixed the problem. My boyfriend and I play on the same internet connection at the same time but he is still having lag. He has a better computer than me, too. The only difference is I'm on a Mac and he's on Windows 8.

-------------------

i had a ping spikes consistently in the 1.5k-4k range last night and saw a ping spike of 11026 the caused everything but the mouse to freeze for a few minutes while someone else was using my computer.I was disconnecting to the point where i actually get booted to the reconnect screen 2-3 times per game. When i did dc, unlike in season 3, i didn't automatically start walking back to base. I was in the exact same place i dced in if i wasnt killed while dcing. I cant trust the connection enough to even consider playing ranked.

-------------------

Ya, this sucks.   'Support' is a joke. I put in a ticket only to receive a condescending reply referring me to their troubleshooting guide. Like I'm a 12 year old and this is my first week playing games online. Whatever, dude...  I'll be playing Destiny...

-------------------

This is BS servers have been trash for over 3 weeks and Riot has done nothing about it they will lose all there player base if they keep this up i have to reconnect 15 times a a game at least i have 15mbs download and 8mbs upload i know its not me i play dota no problems every counterstrike 0 issues as soon as i turn on lol to play oh u have to reconnect to all day every day your service has gone downhill over the years and im sick and tired of u treating ur fans like **** i refuse to spend another $ on league of legands and ik plenty of other people will be quitting your game to dawngate is newer better and keeps there fans happy unlike u money grubbing SOB's ... also dota f2p on steam keep it together ur going to lose all ur fans to dota dawngate or hero's of the storm blizzards new moba or maybe tome also we dont need you anymore riot GET YOUR **** RIGHT U NO LONGGER RUN THE MOBA WORLD

-------------------

stop buying skins and characters, when they see that people aren't maybe they'll raise an eyebrow and investigate why people aren't playing/buying

-------------------

Will we be compensated for all of this?

-------------------

Lost 3 ranked games over 3 days. It's frustrating when you can't move and just see all the **** happen :l

-------------------

wooot attempting to reconnect for 30 mins straight <333333333!

-------------------

Would this also have connection with post champ select, black screen crashes and or error messages saying to change firewall settings?

-------------------

Please Riot answer...

-------------------

My bet is they are going to wait an ENTIRE month and then address the server issue on the 10/9 update. Classy riot, if this continues, you're going to lose have your NA players before 10/9 gets here. I know somebody high up is reading this thread. Instead of sitting there with your fingers up your butt, why don't you give us a damn explanation and an expectation date on when these issues will be resolved.

-------------------

Why you guys still play this game with such garbage support I don't know. Plenty of games out there and riot won't fix a damn thing as long as you keep playing and paying.

It's effecting more games/MOBAs than just LoL. China is DDoSing USA's IP servers, not the games themselves. The games just happen to lag a lot when it happens as a side effect.

-------------------

my favorite thing about this thread is the complete lack of riot posts.

It's like every day with Riot. Come on guys. Pull your heads out..if you want to be a business...run it like one. Thanks..GG WP

Unfortunately riot no longer compensates in any way that appeals to veteran players of this game(remember rp?) 
IMO we'll be lucky to get an ip boost or damage to our rankings undone, most likely an automated apology and thanks for still giving them money-I mean uh being patient 

On board for not playing/buying, playing another couple games and BL1.5 around the corner will definitely make this more bearable.

-------------------

game play experience today  still garbage  gonna keep riot updated everyday until we get a response, cause apparently theyre not aware of the situation

-------------------

am i wrong for saying this but i've never had a game with league under 90 ping ever...

-------------------

how long are they gonna make us wait ?anyone know?..nvm the game starting..yeahhh

-------------------

So I decided to try again after weeks of waiting. First game, DC at 2 minutes with a bugsplat error, come back after the 6 minute marker and stay connected. Second game, black loading screen quitting out to launcher without error message (repeated six times before I got in) once in game, I would "attempt to reconnect" every couple seconds, this would happen every few minutes and last for about 30 seconds to a minute.  I have done thorough testing on my side including: -Full reinstallation of C++ and League of Legends -Virus scans -turning off background programs (RaptR, Curse Voice, Skype, Antivirus etc.) -Chkdsk, sfc, defrag, memtest -I have turned off windows security, both defender and firewall -Ran continuous stability diagnostic on home network and external to ensure there are no dropouts or large fluctuations in connection. -I am on fiber internet, with nothing going except LoL, and Speedtest.net speeds of 700mb down 600mb up  At this time I have to conclude that it is definitely not on my side. *Please everyone perform similar tests and post results, perhaps that will get their attention.*

-------------------

What d3d712a77bdb2f23 said. Literally happens all the time, and have done everything hes done.

-------------------

so for the past couple of weeks when I am in a game I get "attempting to reconnect" and this happens frequently... I will be laning then suddenly I can not move and I dc in place and what normally happens is I just get killed or my team rages at me for not moving. some times it wont even say attempting to reconnect and I will just be unable to move at all very frustrating. Also I am starting to get dealys in game . the champion will go to were I clicked a couple seconds after I have clicked it and not immediately. its getting to the point were I am getting fed up and don't even want to play anymore... i have no background programs running...and i updated my drivers is there anything i can do or is this issue on riots side?

-------------------

I'm utterly astounded at how long the game's been unplayable.   We want URF mode back for good. It'd also be nice if they actually brought the new rift in already.  ...but what does any of it matter if the game can't be played? o_____o

This is getting pretty annoying. How is Riot supposed to take my money if their game won't even work?

For the past two weeks my ping jumps and my screen freezes every minute at the least.

At least give me a loss prevented in my damn series when my sona DCs the entire game and i have 200 ping. THANKS

-------------------

Just noticed that this is the exact same text that you posted regarding the large DDoS attacks from Derptrolling in last december and january. Let me get this straight. You are cutting off the champions lores? You are pumpimg more cash in your skins developpement and sales ( which are all mostly 1350 nowadays even though you guys said it was not gonna be the regular in a near future ). All of this happens at the cost of Under rated servers which lack maintenance and investments. AND YOU CAN'T EVEN COME UP WITH AN ORIGINAL ANSWER WHEN YOU TRY TO JUSTIFY ALL THOSE DECISIONS YOU ARE TAKING? How long do you think '' the game is free '' excuse is still gonna work riot ? Because right now your skins sales are literaly better than never, obviously finances are not a problem with all the you are investing in the Esport scene you are building in north america.  Oh wait i see it coming. A big riot thread or announcement stating : Dear summoner's, due to a high volume of registrations and the popularity of the game, We are in the impossiblity of delivering a good quality service which we think our fans deserve. This is why we are heartbreakingly announcing today that our game, League of Legends, is now gonna be available at the low price of 9,99 per month. We are aware that... and so on.

-------------------

Riot servers receive DDOS attacks, perhaps because of unwarranted bans.   People begin raging because of the server issues.  Riot automates another series of perhaps unwarranted bans.  http://huntergsa.com/wp-content/uplo...n-confused.png (http://huntergsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/jackie-chan-confused.png)

-------------------

Still tons of lag issues in NA. Will it ever get fixed? Is Riot aware even? They haven't posted in a long time.

-------------------

they have so many problems with this ****

-------------------

hi everyone , just leave the league of crash and dc, trash riot server. lets play dota2. at least we have a fluence game experience.

-------------------

Game crash. Game crash. Game crash. Attempting to reconnect. Attempting to reconnect. Attempting to reconnect. Game crash. Attempting to reconnect........  Please do something...

-------------------

OH cmon man... this is ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!

-------------------

So much for auto loss forgiven... Don't worry I LOVE losing ranked games when our team can't connect.

-------------------

so, for the past 7 hours i have been trying to upload the new updates after getting my computer back from the shop and, i had to delete the current icon game and, redownload. and, try to reupdate it once more and, i have not been able to. now its gotten to the irritating concern on why i am unable to get past the update page to sign in. if anyone else is having these problems please, let me know.

-------------------

Oh teh struggle

-------------------

Is this issue ever going to be addressed? Just a statement from Riot at this point would be nice... Feels like the issue/players experiencing it are just being ignored at this point.

-------------------

Riot,Please announce if something really appeared at NA server?  For example:drophack,famous hack at asia server  if not,FIX THE FCUKING SERVER CONNECTION PROBLEM ASAP,I WANT SOME RANK GAME

Dear Riot, this constant issue with disconnects, disconnects and cant get back in until game is over.. and LAG like 1 sec delay, is making me think i should play something else . I have played a lot of games on line and this is the game that I want to play but.... Please show us what, how and why your are doing. It does appear that this problem is getting worse. If it takes Alot of money(what u might say this is too much) to fix i think u should take the BIG money hitand have the servers down for a couple of weeks and get it fixed. I love this game. You have the game right get the "servers" right?

-------------------

Ok. I just got a leaver buster penalty on my account this morning. I am playing on a MAC and lately while in game I have been getting the "Attempting to reconnect". It at times has caused me to leave the game and try to re-enter just to get the game to run properly. It has not been my internet because everything else has been running fine. So why is it i am getting this leaver buster penalty when there is nothing i can do to fix this. RIOT has not done anything to help this cause on the mac. I have seen where a lot of people have been having problems. Why would that even have a MAC client if they aren't going to keep it up to date? They need to take away that leaver buster. Please post to this thread to keep it going because i want to know what is going on here.

-------------------

021d390475e44129 it has nothing to do with the mac client (at least not 
in this scenario) PC users are having the same issues.

-------------------

So how is it fair that I am getting a leaver buster penalty for something i can not control. They say it does not affect us but it does. So when this bans me i had no control whatsoever.

-------------------

servers are some ****

-------------------

It just doesn't make sense that these issues are happening FOR DAYS ON END. I get launching a DDoS attack once and shutting down the servers for a day, but doing it everyday and causing massive lag to everyone for days on end? It seems like if that were happening it would seem like some form of computer forensics could track where the information is coming from and find the attacker.   Also, why would someone go through so much trouble to attack the servers for days on end?   I feel like this is actually an issue with the servers and they're just stating its DDoS attacks to avoid bad press or something...

-------------------

So, I have mentioned here before that I was going to stop playing the game until the issue is resolved but I just couldn't help myself because as everyone else here knows, the game is so fun (when it works) but in every other match I played, the ridiculous trying tor reconnect thing was always there waiting for me. Today, it seemed to haunt me almost every single game.  Then I was playing ARAM and got Zilean. So I casted Time Warp and was clicking towards the enemy team to give them some yummy, sure to be annoying Time Bombs and the game lagged hard as soon as I started flying towards them. 2 minutes later, I was back at the base and apparently I had given the enemy team first blood. Yeah, unplayable. I have learned my lesson after that. No more LoL until this is fixed... Maybe in 2016?

-------------------

So is it just the servers that are all messed up. I can not play a single game without getting an attempting to reconnect. And I am now playing on Windows 8.1... But my cousin plays and they have no problems so i do not get whats going on.

-------------------

league wont even let me log on right now, just takes 2 mins to tell me that there is a connection error. -.-

-------------------

The games literally unplayable. Ping doesn't move at all and there's a 20 second delay then indefinite "Attempting to reconnect".

-------------------

It's been every game I've played recently. Had to leave game, reconnect, leave game again and reconnect again multiple times before it seemed somewhat stable.  It's been like this for over 2 weeks for me

-------------------

The game is unplayable and sucks, at the moment. I'm sure it has been considered and rejected for some excellent reason, but why not make the server available for LAN games, at least for custom games. Don't award any IP or experience, don't record the results, don't worry about it. It will simply be a way for players who do not care about their Summoner Level or ever getting ranked to play and have fun. The result will be to substantially reduce load on RITO servers, and to allow people to play and have fun with the game even when the servers are unavailable for whatever reason. As a fun bonus, it will allow 5v5 queue teams to scrimmage or game scenarios without making a record or getting banned for DC or whatever.  I posted a long post on the Boards on how I might envision it working: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/VuYGOouG-a-modest-proposal-to-deal-with-ddos-lottery.

-------------------

The biggest issue I'm finding lately is that with all these DC's, entire teams are getting 'Leaver' status and even getting notified that they're under watch for having left too many games, when every single one isn't even player controllable. I understand servers having issues, but PUNISHING US for those server issues is a tad intense.

-------------------

I will be back playing league when you actually fix these problems. This has gotten too rediculous for me to justify playing anymore until its fixed.

-------------------

sometimes lag spikes too much to the point that i cant even move fix pls

-------------------

not enough effort put towards fixing these month long issues.

-------------------

yea win 16 points loose 20 **** u **** this game **** the money grubing *****es

-------------------

I can't play anymore im not even exaggerating  the ping spikes are just too strong. one second im 150 the next im 800+ or even 2000+ the entire game all i see is the (attempting to reconnect) message while i see my hp bar go down  even got a notification for being afk too much

-------------------

Well, I finally got a response via twitter about this. RiotSupport had this to say when I referenced this forum. "We have not seen any serverwide issues on NA lately. If your still seeing issues, the root cause may be something different"  I have asked them to please reference the post I made on page 108, which details all of the steps already gone through to address this.  Please everyone post what you have done on your side to prove that it is not a problem with your individual machines.

-------------------

It's not my internet I'm using ethernet.... Everyone knows this problem is on Riot's end.

-------------------

I have tried and tried and tried to play, over the last few weeks i havnt had a game that didnt result in anything but attempting to reconnect roughly half the match. People reporting me for lagging out and i cant help it... ive tried all the "suggestions" you have made but nothing. if anything, its worse.   League use to be my escape and now it is just pissing me off every time i play. Please do something about this, im sure yall are aware of the issue... here is my situation  Until then, im not dropping another penny on this game.

-------------------

This problem is on riot's end. I'm using the same rig and internet and setup I've played for months and months with no issues and no changes. I just suddenly got horrible performance, lag, and tons of disconnects. I have no issues with other online games either (BF4, DOTA2, etc). I wish Riot would at least post something acknowledging this.

-------------------

Yeah,same problem around the world Thailand,Hong Kong,USA,Taiwan,Maxico What's wrong they have both?playing LoL NA server Anymore?  Wake up please riot

This post hurts me inside.

-------------------

The "match found" window wont appear on my client anymore, and recently I've been getting lag spikes around enemy champs, please fix yo game riot. DDOS might I guess be a hard situation but I hope its fixed soon. I can play any other game on my computer with any number of programs open, without having wtfast on, and it still performs better than your game open alone on my computer WITH wtfast. tha****isthis?!  I will be standing lets say, in a bush in ascension, then I will click an enemy champ, rotation of spells, and my champ overlaps the enemy champ, "attempting to reconnect" teleports back to bush and is dead with no mana missing signifying none of my spells went... What the **** kind of lag is this? I've never had it before till ascension,and nothing will fix this sad sad game.

-------------------

i don't know if this is where i post this but, i was in a ranked game and it was my third game in gold 3 promos and we were winning by a large margin and then the game crashed and that whole game is not even in my history anymore. then i played another and lost my promos. kinda frustrating, just wanted to see if anything could come from this

-------------------

I live in North America but I cannot use the NA servers due to lag/disconnects. I went over to EUW and played a game with absolutely zero lag.

-------------------

Nothing has been done to fix this yet, I heard dota 2 has nice servers maybe I should go play that

-------------------

Lag

-------------------

I've sent a support ticket. I believe that anyone else who is having this Attempting to Reconnect issue should also send in a support ticket asking for Networking staff to investigate the servers, with evidence that there is no way that there is anything wrong on your end of the game.

-------------------

Lol Riot's probably one of the least caring companies ever. Someone needs to buy league with a no-compete clause.

-------------------

Hey guys... I may have found a solution (at least a temporary one)  Go to your League Launcher and disable Peer-To-Peer transfer under the settings tab.  Worked for me, ping back to normal and no spikes.

-------------------

gettin real tired of this ****.

-------------------

how many people need to quit before you'll even dignify us with a response riot? seriously. this isnt a small issue you can sweep under the rug.

Did you try disabling peer to peer transfers from your league launcher?? I 
think it worked for me but i'd like some feedback to see if it works for 
others.

-------------------

i did that like 4 months ago. thats old news.

When you repair the client it selects peer-to-peer transfers again... did you make sure it's not selected lol? Don't repair anything just de-select peer to peer it instantly solved the lag/dc problem for me.

Extend the Ascension mode then, I cant get all the amazing Icons if the servers are down during the event.

Hey Everyone, 
Over the last couple of days, many of you have experienced some problems while playing the game. YouÂve seen reconnect spikes, issues with game starts, and very large login queue in many occasions. We wanted to take some time to give you all a little more information on whatÂs going on, since we havenÂt spoken much about this since the issues started occurring. 

In the last couple weeks our datacenter and game have been the target of some DDOS attacks. The results of these attacks have caused instability in our service. WeÂve been experiencing large attacks that have been filling up a significant chunk of bandwidth and causing parts of our system to lose connection to each other. The end result is a poor play experience for you all. While weÂve been able to turn on our loss forgiven feature as soon as the attack is detected, this does not equal a good play experience. 

While we canÂt share the details of the work we are doing internally to combat this (since it would give the attackers information to circumvent it), we want you to know that we are tackling this from many different angles. This includes working with our datacenter and internet service provider partners, as well as developing tools and services internally to make our service more robust against these types of attacks. Defending against DDOS attacks is an arms race that we will always be engaged in, and we are committed to reducing the pain you all feel as swiftly as possible when the service is being impacted by malicious attacks. 

We want you to know that this is the top priority for the Live Services team. We share your frustration at the impact of these attacks, and we are working to make sure you can play the game every time you want to. 

-Ryan 

Thank youuuuuu

Do I win an award for having my ping hit 21,000 one game? That's got to be some kind of record right?

It's always good to hear that a company is doing what they can. I wish you luck in your efforts of preventing these wannabe "hacker" punks from messing with you. I would like to recommend you get in contact with Blizzard, I know they were the first to recover and have had no more issues since the first couple days. Whatever they did worked wonders, and they may be willing to share what they did with you. In a perfect world anyway. Good luck, and whatnot.

-------------------

Via twitter @riotsupport swears the problem is on our side not theirs. they read my post on page 108 and have said this. "There's still a few things you can try, specifically listed in this guide https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/26932010-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues Â"  Please all follow that and see if it helps you. Then post results.

-------------------

Often unable to reconnect

-------------------

Still disconnecting.

-------------------

It's been 3 weeks. Still no update on riot's part. Had 5 4v5s in the past 10 games I've played. Can someone tell me how I'm supposed to carry solo queue when it's 4v5 the whole or at least for half the game? It's just like riot is brushing us all of whenever we try to get a response. Riot provides ambiguous information, leaves, afks for a month or two, comes back and then states the problem. What a great company.

-------------------

Thaaaaaaaaaank Youuuuuuu -VideoGameDunkey, while playing Kingdom Hearts-

-------------------

lag is back......... havn't been able to play this game without 200+ ping and dc's for about 2 months now riot

-------------------

I cannot say that the problem is resolved for me as I have not tested enough but I ensured that all of RIOT's ports are forwarded in my router and turned off Peer to Peer in the launcher and played three games without lag.  You should all try this. I know you were probably working fine, but I was too until the most recent patch, perhaps this will help you.

-------------------

2 games with full on lag... even with peer to peer disabled _- anyone know whats going on?

-------------------

Guys I found a solution, EUW works fine ... lol =)

-------------------

Are you kidding me? Past three games non stop lag, ping spikes and attempting to reconnect. This is just ridiculous now and of course your not going to say anything or even admit that it's been going on for months maybe even years for some people. You have the funds to upgrade or even just replace your entire NA server.

-------------------

attempting to reconnect... all the the time

-------------------

You know you're an embarrassment for a company when your servers are such trash that you stop telling your players you're going to fix it.

-------------------

Didn't experience any lag today while playing around 1400. Now, I log on, decide to play a ranked game, and bam, dc all game. Great, just great. 4th week and counting.

-------------------

Front page reddit post along with a video on the lag issues: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2gbkec/ever_since_411_412_this_has_been_the_norm_for_me/  Upvote for awareness please.  Surely Riot will have a hard time saying it's on our end at this point.

-------------------

**** you riot. this problem has literally ruined my experience of league of legends to the point where I have almost quit the game all together. Fix your ****ing servers. Im glad to see you have finally focused on fixing it after months of disconnecting over and over again. Finally you actually give a ****.

Upvoted, everyone with this issue should do it as well. Riot has had the chance to respond to us on these forums about this strange lag.

-------------------

nice

-------------------

the hackers causing others to dc.. start banning them please. ran into one last game and i couldnt even play the game until i called them out on it. scared them too much for them to keep using it.   until the hackers are gone and the hacks fixed im done playing this game.  ps my client got pinged by their program causing it to display some weird text in the chat box just after i called them out on it.

-------------------

Recently my connection has been having lots of lots of problem. I rarely could enjoy a game without freezing or disconnection. I seriously doubt whether Riot has been working on it or not.  Please, I started playing LoL in S1 and I don't want my experience to be ruined by some hackers or server's problem. Just fix it or at least let us know Riot is working on it.  Having no response on connection's problem while introducing new products makes us mad.

-------------------

I don't understand why you guys are even trying anymore. Riot refuses to acknowledge the problem on their end which will continue to make it ****ty for everybody. Find a new game. Riot is killing it's own game.  Continue playing the game without a fix from Riot and you just tell them that it's ok for them to have an unplayable game because you will play it no matter what and still give them money. Stop playing or stfu is all it comes down to.   If you think Riot cares then you have bigger issues.

-------------------

Apparently they are still under the impression all these problems are on our side. I just got a response from support saying "To fix this issue, you will need to contact your network administrator and have them configure their network to prioritize League of Legends traffic. This usually requires providing a full list of our server IPs and required Ports"  oh well....maybe they will see the reddit post with 2000+ upvotes and eventually do something.

-------------------

This **** is still happening

-------------------

Hey Riot cant you guys turn off the ranked decay feature, there are people like myself who have lost entire tiers because we can't play rank to keep the LP up. I mean If i queue up for rank I would only give free LP, plus 4 other people on my team loses LP as well. It's to late for me now, I'm back down to silver from straight decay and I doubt I will get a chance in a long time to climb again the way things look. Atleast you can save others by removing the decay or postponing it. Which in turn is a big source of frustration amongst the players who are venting and bashing their 3rd computer screens.

Or you could read my previous post and see that for some people forwarding their ports and disabling peer to peer transfer does fix the problem.

Ever since I did what d3d712a77bdb2f23 pointed out, I've been generally lag free. I can't say that it completely fixed my problems since it's been only a day or so but I haven't had the usual ~500 ping spike/disconnect/game crash problem. 

What exactly does peer to peer transfer do btw? I'm not missing out on anything because I disabled it, am I?

-------------------

d3d712a77bdb2f23 that actually doesnt solve any problems.. port forwarding actually increased my ping for whatever reason. my guess is it is showing closer to what it really is but the in game ping number is never very accurate as far as showing how laggy you are, it actually stays at my normal ping showing me the attempting to reconnect bs while allowing me to move around and use skills if i click somewhere, whole reason im about to start playing only champs with short cd skill shots if i ever play again, but i never see my own champ move unless i use a skill.  the client is fine for the first 3-4 games i always play... and almost never happens during bots unless the server starts getting ddosd by someone who is really pissed off.. but it almost always happens in normals/arams when my team is doing good then continues for 2-3 games even if my team is doing bad.. then it magically stops until my team starts doing good again. so tell me again how it isnt a bunch of kids with programs and hacks causing the problems. oh and try playing aram at 5 am eastern time up until about 10 am. thats when it gets really bad to the point i cant even stay in game for more than 30 seconds at a time... and did i mention im literally the only one on my internet at the time? i kicked everything but my desktop off the internet and turn off everything but league on my computer when it happens and it doesnt stop so it isnt my connection that is messed up.

No you will not be missing out, peer to peer helps transfer data faster, 
but it's pointless if it causes issues, best to leave it off for now.

-------------------

disabled peer to peer, forwarded correct ports for LoL, internet service is exceptional, still getting random ping spikes in game.....  any headway on fixing this?

-------------------

.

-------------------

yes i did disable peer to peer and it isnt my connection to the server either. the damn client keeps saying "Unit Userdata 08xxxxxx" notice the 4 byte number? its a memory leak from the client or the server or something and its happened to pretty much every other person in the games that ive been in that have had lag. only when it pings those user data bytes does it lag.

-------------------

Riot please permanently ban me. I'm tired off this ****ing peice of **** laggy game. Every time I play rank I'm placed with a ****ty team that i try so hard to carry. I go 19/10 but my team still ****ing loses.

I cant even redownload the game. **** you guys

-------------------

I'm still getting the same issues in NA.  I've made a smurf account in EUW and will test it extensively in coop vs AI games. I will let you all know the results.

-------------------

the people I have met are not asking me to Q with them any longer bc of this... Thank You Riot appreciate IT!

-------------------

Can you guys pls look into this? I have found that when I play cpu games I get tons of people using scripts to play mid. The game tends to lag more and to have to reconnect. If tons of players are using scripts or whatever they are using to play they could create a ton of traffic which could lag out other games. Maybe looking at people who go 0 kills and a good amount of deaths maybe greater than 5? This could help get rid of people who are blatenly cheating and may be causing the lag the servers are experiencing.

-------------------

Your stuff is still BROKE.... "complete" definition please?

-------------------

You guys are just terrible at trying to "fix" your game, just stop bull****ting and tell the truth and tell your players that all you care about is money now and not about fixing your game.

-------------------

Fix the goddamn problem and stop wasting my time!

-------------------

You guys have become greedy and irresponsible. DDOS attacks my ass! Stop spitting lies and get to the point!

-------------------

I can't even download the patch to open the game, it stays in 33% forever. I have restarted, updated windows, and everything, but every time I try... 33% for hours. I haven't been able to play in a month. North America servers or my PC?

-------------------

i have been having a lot of lag spikes like every 10min.

-------------------

After about 5 games in EUW, I have had no problems whatsoever.   Bear in mind, I've tried all the solutions that others on this thread have posted and all the suggestions available on the website. Nothing has worked; I can't stay connected to the NA servers for more than 30 seconds before I start to get major lag and serial disconnects.   I am convinced that the issue is Riot's and that it is affecting their NA server. I am going to continue to test my connection on EUW, and if I consistently have no issues I'm go to transfer my account there. It would actually be really classy of Rito to let me do it for free, given it's a technical issue, though I suspect that won't happen.

They just want to be an eSport. They'd be happy if none of us played... just sitting and watching some Koreans guys fighting each other round after round. 

Devote time and money away from their precious sports? Hah!

-------------------

9 games of Ascension later and I've yet to actually have 5 people on each team. Ridiculous. Never spending another penny on this game.

-------------------

I was playing the whole day with a nice 80ms ping, now i'm getting a constant 300+ ping per game with 2k+ ping spikes every 5 seconds. What the hell riot.

-------------------

whats wrong with u guys? every game im in this last patch it has always been someone afk like rlly whats wrong and every patch there is this big instability wave and everyone is just afk pls fix this soon.

jesus this serve is complete ****...

-------------------

Guessing there's DDoS again tonight. Game crashed and I tried relogging. Now it's scanning a thousand files... It scanned up to 600 files. Then I closed it and reopened it to see if it'd just stop...but it started rescanning the files. Apparently I shouldn't have closed it. 1,000 files scanned now while my teammates are 4v5'ing. Sadly, I had to be the ADC that DC's so solo bot lane for my support.

Riot, we know you aren't being DDOS'd. You're just running the same servers that you did when LoL first came out. Take some time and overhaul your servers. Stop lying to us please.

they literally think where stupidim calling it. between sever

tried to 1v5 and it is failing me and when im 10 ten kill ahead of 
everyone on games where im geting to play i know damn well im doing 
something right

-------------------

Welp. Took TWELVE minutes of force stopping and restarting to get into a game. There, it was 1 person disconnected from the beginning, me and another person disconnecting the entire time.   Like, all LoL is now is watching AN ANIMATED GIF of your character either running in place, spazzing out in place, running fast in place, or running in slow motion in place.  This is no DDOS attack. It's glitchy as hell, too. I'm there looking at peoples' health bars on their icons to the left stretching all the way out from their boxes.  Riot's lying to us. They clearly BROKE the programming somewhere and are too chicken to tell us.  Not like us North Americans even matter to them anymore. It's ALL about their Korean eSports now.  :: plays DOTA ::

-------------------

I really wish Riot would just get their stuff together and fix the damned servers. It's getting really out of hand and there are no excuses except for we're lazy because we all know that they aren't getting DDOS'D anymore. It is literally impossible to play a game of LoL with out lag spikes or just massive lag in general.

-------------------

That's if you can even GET into a game beyond character select.

-------------------

and this **** is happening again like yesterday a normal match need to take 5 min and until then it froze but my timer is still going

-------------------

yep its started again./..... OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!

Same here man... smaething different day... or dollar!

-------------------

How about letting me log in riot? That'd be great, real firewalls to block people ddosing you would be good to invest in with the millions of dollars you make from the community you are trying(and failing) to please half the time.

-------------------

Man, the ddosers can relax, riot server connections are so crappy the don't even have to attack them now.

-------------------

The difference between a good company and a bad company is this:  The servers for good, profitable companies *NEVER (or so rarely it shouldn't be considered) GO DOWN*. If a server goes down for even a minute, it's seen as a catastrophe. Tech goons are all over the place trying to recover them. Riot's like herp de derp, CHIPMUNKS AND BUTTERFLIES? SHINY!

-------------------

and once again... YOUR LAG TO THE EAST COAST IS BACKKKKKKKKKKKKK ( for an hour it was good)

-------------------

I haven't even been able to log in since August 21. For whatever reason I was able to actually log in and play last Friday for a few hours before it went back to showing the "Connection Failure: Unable to the PVP.net server" error.  This is such bull****. The fact that they're not even posting in this thread anymore shows that they're ignoring the huge volume of people having issues. I understand their priorities have and will continue to revolve 100% around the professional scene but guess what? OTHER PEOPLE PLAY YOUR GAME TOO RIOT.

-------------------

Lagging ever since i started, nothing wrong with my isp. RIOT, please fix your **** so i can enjoy the game. Really hard for me to call this my favorite game if i CANT play it. I cant even play a bot game with nothing but me and computers

-------------------

seriously riot i dont see the point making a mid laner mage so dam weak come on now this is a mage we talking about AZIR IS SO DAM WEAK HE NOT EVEN OP i was i can delete him waste of my time buying a weak mid lane mage

Please no.

Season 3 was a disaster.

-------------------

So when my game screen suddenly stops completely and then flips a few dozen frames ahead a second or two later, that's been the Riot server, and not my ISP?

-------------------

I understand that Riot might not be having problems with their servers (could be something else), but why are they still ignoring us? Something is obviously wrong when half of the people I play with lag constantly.  It would be nice if we could get some information. ANY information would help diagnose the problem.

-------------------

what Has riot done to try and stop the people from DDOS ing [LEAGUE OF LEGENDS] again?

-------------------

Sigh there's always gotta be that one guy that wants to rain on our parade. I wish you the best of luck in staving off these attacks. I hope it will be in time for Azir's release.

-------------------

I havent been able to play in a week in a half due to severe lag problems. You guys really need to fix your servers! My dream is to be in the lcs someday and I cant practice or get better in any way when I literally dc every 10-20 seconds.

-------------------

For those of you who are still lagging, try DAWNGATE, it is same as leagues and it is fun and there is no lag in their server. Actually the game is pretty fun and playable.   Most of my friends left leagues because they said it lags so much especially when they are at their promotions match.This game is just becoming horrible and unplayable. Have already spent more than 300$ on this game, stupid me, should have spent it on a console game or something else.   As far as it is concern the NA server has been like this since the start of Summer or since patch 4.10. Therefore, it is like Riot doesn't even give a damn to it...  I mean who the hell will go to DDOS Riot 365 on 365 day a year, they surely have better thing to do. I mean Dota 2 and Dawngate doesn't even get that problem.  That game is going to die if it continue like this and Riot will be in trouble since League is their only game that they release so far... One thing for sure the MOBA world has changed already and Riot is no longer the sole player in this field. IF they really don't care about this problem. Well, no problem for us as player, we can always go to play something else and spend our money somewhere else...   Riot seriously... your server is worst than Runescape so much lag spike...

-------------------

Lagging once again. Just had a 30 minute bot match and I spent at least 15 minutes of it disconnected. Play 1-2 minutes, disconnected 1-2 minutes. Just non stop.

Honestly at this point, the best we can do as a community is to submit support tickets regarding the issue to help Riot diagnose what the problem is. Most of these people sitting here cursing out Riot and crying isn't going to solve anything, they need actual data to work off of.

-------------------

Just get anti-bot software. The bots have overtaken my ability to learn how to play.

-------------------

THANK GOD, I thought I was the only one!

-------------------

Other than being an *******, don't see why someone would want to do this to League of Legends, though if you think about someone could perhaps be doing this cause they are competition to League of Legends, DOTA 2 has been around long enough and doubt they would do it, DC's not the type to pull it, idk anything about Smite's creators though, there are lesser known game out there, had one once but it was alot like Smite is but mostly Acension style game play. doubtful it is actually a competitor or employee of one doing it, probably some troll out there that really wants to ruin peoples fun.

-------------------

I get dc'd from game restart modem 3 times no good, have to restart comp, when I get back in, cant connect to game cause it says under match history I left. we were winning, dc'd just as I was about to pull someone near mid turret. Grrrrr.

-------------------

Maybe if they just unfairly ban a ****load of people, the servers will get better...   1073460

-------------------

I am currently attempting to download league onto my mac mini for the third time but it freezes at 32 percent during the patch update and an unspecified error box appears with a submit log that honestly doesn't seem very helpful. Tried to delete program and re download but reaching the same error case at the same point. any tips on this issue or could it be the Azir update and server attack have something to do with this?

8e65b082c4262407 seriously needs to get fired.I got banned for 14 days 
for telling a enemy Darius that I would destroy him. (I was Garen)Riot's 
logic is to mass-ban nearly everyone for petty reasons while the real 
toxic players continue feeding, being homophopic/racist, and raging.

Just want to ask, what is being done about the problems other than the DDos attacks, like the latency and packet loss? It is getting frustrating seeing my self die on my screen and not being able to do anything about it .  <3 really want to know

this lol. I've been talking to riot support/submitting tickets on eu for a week now and nothings happened. Twitter guys were x10 more helpful though, at least.

Speaking of twitter guys, they did point me in the right direction to fixing my connectivity issues, however no matter how much I ask them to pay attention to this thread nobody seems to care. I've submitted tickets, posted on their facebook, and sent them twitter messages for three weeks to bring attention to the people here calling for help.

-------------------

I think Riot may want to look into the problem with all the Mac users as there have been many complaints ever since the 4.16 patch has come out, not sure if this is based off their Instability or not.

-------------------

give riot a break i mean really its not like they dont pay attention..... at least most of the time lol we are all having problems and they are working on fixing them, posting the same thing over and over is only disruptive. and those who are being little 12 year olds saying riot is terrible and so on need to STEP AWAY FROM YOUR COMPUTER and take a chill pill, YOU ARE NOT THERE ONLY PRIORITY and you are only being disrutive. i dont really think they should give you your stuff back when you were the one who played ranked when you {hopefully} knew about the server issues, although i have lost ip in the past for playing ranked when they have been haveing disruptive servers i just think its stupid that you all want stuff because this, or that. go to seven11 and get yourself a damm slurpy and cool off. heat is bothering all of us riot doent deserve your 92% of the time negitivity.    PS RIOT DESERVES A COOKIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

-------------------

Problems every other day for about a year or so... Ya.... You guys need to step your game up something heavy.. I don't think a week has gone by that the NA server hasn't needed maintenance or fixes. It's getting pretty ridiculous.

I agree but they are doing a lot at once. as far as azir goes i think his ult going through turrents was sweet. XD

still not fixed

I am really not trying to irritate them, but I cannot seem to get them to respond to you all.  I would urge you to take them up on this offer and try their ticket system. I hope it helps you.

took 3 days playing with lag and also check my wifi and call my provider interned and no doubt that is the server please take that into account

all are bots? What happened?

e.e

-------------------

what is this

-------------------

All of this is still occurring    Riot is there any word on if these problems can be resolved soon? My stats are looking horrible due to these problems.

-------------------

Little hard for some to speak about US and "negativity" when you buy a product, as in RP, and for a very long time (no, not "weeks&quot it ends up just being a frustrating waste... all the while with them STILL spending all this money on the WRONG thing, all the stupid eSports garbage instead of fixing the game so it, you know, FUNCTIONS.  Enough already.   "DDOS attacks" my butt. You guys BROKE programming somewhere.

d3d712a77bdb2f23:

Less enjoyable was when I started this game about 50% of all ranked games I played had people dc, not connect, rage quit, or troll and then they made it better by their new ranked system. Now 1 loss from a troll can take the rewards from 3 wins.

-------------------

Can we get like some in game ads to help pay for better servers or better programmers?

-------------------

I am very angry and upset about going down in levels, but what else is new. I do have a legitimate question to ask about the level system given this recent intermittent lag. The first question is wouldn't adding additional servers or setting up servers to automatically be brought online in a heavy data usage time frames help to deal with the attacks?  The second is more of a confusion: If it takes me 3 out of 5 games to move up why don't I have to play to move down? It is a very common logical phase of many sporting events that a loser or losing team has to go to a different level of playoffs for a wild cars spot. Riot has used this very thing in different tournaments.   Lastly why cant i join a 5v5 with more than 2 people and less than 5? I understand you want people to play 3v3 and no arguments there but do you think I'm going to go play that if I have more than 2 people? I'm not going to, to be honest. I highly doubt to get serious answers but maybe???

-------------------

I was just in a ranked game with my buddy when the server crashed. What will happen to game? Will i get demoted? Try to fix this please

-------------------

So do to your instable servers and no loss prevented and leave 
forgivness one of my account was banned today for afking all of the 
leaves on the account were issues with your server and I wasn't the only 
person who left the match in one instance 3 people on each teams were 
gone and I was banned for "leaving" I spent money on this game I 
should've be punished because you can't keep your servers clean or 
secure. I would like the ban lifted or forgiven so if I do eventually 
leave a match I will be punished with the one day please thank you for 
your time the account name is 85264a519f72373e I know its ironic but I 
didn't know being Toxic was a term when I first started playing this 
game.

-------------------

hey man, seriously I appreciate all your guys hardwork and understand 
about that issue, its been affecting me as well, I got promoted and 
demoted very annoying for me, got an idea though, why not make demotion 
after like 10 loses in a row cuz this whole 3 thing is killing me and im 
sure a lot of people im definately not a b5 i been prmotoed so many damn 
times and most of the times im demoted due your system and lag probablly 
from the attacks and also due to trolls, just the other day i 
encountered a famous troll called bca9c028a015a118, stuff like this is 
killing the game for newbs.

-------------------

So this is the reason why my ping recently increased a 30% from itÂ´s normal range? This has been my issue since the last 2 weeks...

-------------------

so....i just got dced from a game twice due to "game missing code"....yea you wanna fix that

-------------------

How much longer until we get this fix im pretty tired of being in the middle of a game (any game be it ranked or a !@#$ bot match) and getting the Attempting to Reconnect to server message. I know you got a lot of things going on (especially with worlds going on right now) but come on there has gotta be something you can do for those of us who play for fun and not professional. IJS look out for the little people too.

-------------------

man all kinds of weird stuff has been happening this month lagging out of games with only 100 some ping. loading games to 95 percent then it crashes at in game loading screen multiple times. it's really unfair. i hope things get fixed soon because until then i'm probably done cause my game history is getting wrecked by this. best of luck with repairs riot.

-------------------

took a week break from league to let you guys try and get your act together.  still no updates on the problem.  gameplay experience rating:  still garbage  just keeping you updated riot.

-------------------

16 mb download 1.5 mb upload 0 packet loss during the entire game  Literally, was unable to get out of the base the entire game. I really don't know why I even bother any more. Seems pretty clear to me at this point that they aren't going to bother fixing the issue until it effects a larger portion of their audience.

-------------------

Cmon we cant even play right now riot

-------------------

I am having the same problem. Just tried to play a ranked game. I didn't get to farm one minion. Attempting to reconnect the whole game and my internet is fine. 17mbps and 1.65 upload speed with a 17 ping. So when I send tickets into riot and they say its my internet they are full of it. I already got a Level 1 Leaver buster penalty because of there nonsense. Can they really not see people constantly disconnecting from the games? Or they just do not care if the leaver buster bans you for there servers?

-------------------

Just had a game where my ping stayed in the 1.4k-2k range for every second of gameplay, start to finish.  Internet connection is fine, websites work fine, other games work fine, but try and play a game of ranked? Prepare for an absolute infuriating slog.  League was working perfectly well last night, even. What gives?

-------------------

I'm curious why you guys think riot cares? Honestly if they did they would fix the problems. I know the game is fun and all and we all have something invested but why do you guys actually think Riot cares? Especially with the problems getting worse over the years and not better.

-------------------

I am seeing unbelievable packet loss. I can do every other internet activity without issue. Here are my last two games on LogsofLag: http://logsoflag.com/#lmIhNjkQ_Lx http://logsoflag.com/#s5ggyYPwt90  My ping goes up and down wildly, never below 250 for more than a few seconds, and often above 3000.  This only began happening within the last few weeks. It's totally debilitating in-game.

-------------------

Ya Me and my buddy and i'm guessing the whole team just got lagged out of a match attempted to recconnect multiple times, kept saying the game crashed please recconnect and you've encountered a firewall, even though a firewall never gets put up for leagues. My buddys at a different end of the city different computer different internet provider. Yet i bet the stupid ass ban hammer still comes into effect and it counts as leaving a game. Also apparently if i was in a series it would end it. Thats pathetic, what am i supposed to do wait it out? Thats stupid as eff, i've been banned before for lagging out multiple times in a row with an older computer and service provider, i wouldn't be surprised if you guys get ddos'd enough for people to get banned and not play.

-------------------

So umm this has been happening since patch 4.10 for me and I'm about to get banned for it. See what will happen is I will be fine for a couple of games then all of a sudden the game will just disconnect. I won't be able to reconnect and if I attempt to restart the client I won't be let back into my game. Welp it was fun while it lasted.

-------------------

Hello I a problem with my leagu of legends I can ouvrire lol until no problem I write my account and my password and a message displays and me enmpeche of connect me " login error the login severdid not respond. you gaunt may has connection issuie that is not related to the league of legends sever.

Contact player support(medium) at...

Getting tired of the instability of the sever and the lags and crashes of some games. hope you guys fix this soon and put the games on "LOSS PREVENTION"

-------------------

Lol **** this .2 ranked games lagged like **** and then just crashes tried everything to reconnect when i finally go into the loading screen the game crashed ....and no loss prevention and it not my computer or my internet .

still happening to me

-------------------

I just got ****ing banned for leaverbuster when its their servers causing all my disconnects. My net is perfectly fine. Riot needs to get their **** together.

-------------------

i just had the worst game ever, i started with lag, but that wasn't enough, we got disconnected, everyone on the game.when i'm finally reconnected, i could only, play like for 5 minutes. then i got disconnected again, i wasn't happy, but i was expecting the "loss forgiven" but not, when i look at the match history they give me the "leave". not cool at all, this had happened to me like hundred of times, i really want to go farther in ranked and for things like those, i haven't win my promos to get gold 5.

After about 5 games in EUW, I have had no problems whatsoever. 

Bear in mind, I've tried all the solutions that others on this thread have posted and all the suggestions available on the website. Nothing has worked; I can't stay connected to the NA servers for more than 30 seconds before I start to get major lag and serial disconnects. 

I am convinced that the issue is Riot's and that it is affecting their NA server. I am going to continue to test my connection on EUW, and if I consistently have no issues I'm go to transfer my account there. It would actually be really classy of Rito to let me do it for free, given it's a technical issue, though I suspect that won't happen. 

After about 30+ games on EU West I have had no issues whatsoever. I asked Riot tech support to either help me or transfer my character from NA to EU West for free because it's a technical issue. They provided no technical support other than an apology (although I provided them with my network analysis), and denied my request to transfer my character. I guess if I want to play with the skins and characters I bought over a 2 year period I have to pay around 2600 RP for the transfer. 

It honestly seems like it would be against the law to do that - to hold my account hostage unless I pay to transfer it. I'll speak with some people about this to see if Riot can actually get away with such a stance. I'll keep you all posted.

-------------------

is that why I cant win a bronze when I go 20/10 pretty much every game? F.U. LAGGGGGG???

-------------------

It's too bad this massive packet loss and server issue won't happen during the worlds games...Maybe then riot would realize the severity of the issue.

-------------------

Riot you are retarded lol is meant to be a fun game to play but not when you get op as **** champs such a akali who come and 1 shot you in the first 5 min i think you should nerf alot of champs so it's fair cause akali is op and for some reason she can tank more tower shot's than rammus it is retarded the game is not fair for everyone aswell i think that we should be able to send champions over from 1 account to another without having to use rp i think we should be able to send champs ip and runes over to diffrent accounts and nerf some champs the game is retarded you idiots

I didn't want to believe it was DDOS attacks until i heard something official from Riot on this, but i guess we all know now. 

Thanks for the update. 

With all due respect, I've never seen a DDoS attack that randomly causes lag spikes for some people and not others. Some of these games, I'm one of MAYBE 3 people lagging horrendously, while some of these games, I'm literally the only one having any issue. Look, it's not a DDoS. Be honest. What is wrong with your servers, and what are you really doing, if anything, to fix it? 

If it is some kind of DDoS attack, who did you piss off enough to have it going on, literally nonstop (unless it stops while I sleep) like this? And why haven't you been able to put a stop to this yet? 

Some of your posters are saying it's been going on for months. Look, some of your gamers were DDoS'ing a LoL hack site (Will not name it), and they actually fixed it. If some little hack scripter can figure out a way, why can your team not? Also, why is it that almost no other game has these issues? I mean, REAL MLG GAMES do not have this issue. Look at the valve games - DotA 2, CS:GO, etc - StarCraft II, WarCraft III, etc. What's the deal that you guys, who have made a LOT of money on this game (in some cases, players have bought literally thousands of dollars of RP on one account, and I know this to be a fact), cannot seem to fix it? 

If it is a DDoS, you should have been able to fix it by now. But we all know that you guys are working on a lot of changes. Every time you update, patch, change, add, etc something... Well, not to sound rude, but you break 2 or 3 other things. Is it possible that this is truly a case of "Riot 'fixed' something that wasn't broken" - again? If so, do you maybe need to rethink the people you have hired? If not, maybe the people in the server thinktanks need to have their payscales thought about.. 

I don't know, but until I hear that these problems are fixed (And perhaps I'll occasionally test myself), I'm done with this game. I just can't handle playing, doing great (or playing a character I should be doing great on), and having the game kill me. The game. Not me, not my enemies (who got the kill), but the game... Working against me. It's just unplayable in this state. 

Some games work great, some games are fine with a little bit of lag - but then I just attempted a duo queue ranked game (after almost no lag all day)... And sure enough, I'm so laggy that I go 5/6 as Azir against AP Ezreal... Look, when I wasn't lagging, I was wrecking him. But once I started lagging (And, mind you, I'm the ONLY one lagging in this specific game, so I look like I'm just a piece of **** denying helping my team)... Well, I went 0/3 until I could finally get into the real teamfights and get lucky (lucky as in, no lag!), and wreck a double kill here, a triple here, wreck a turret with Azir's lovely W here, etc... 

We won. But just barely. I just can't play like this. 

Once you fix your problems, I have some more money for you guys. I only have 51 characters.. Need to fix that! Lol.. Love your game, love (most of) the ways your company works... But don't love your servers atm. 

Good luck, and good night!

you need mr and hp. you also need to understand that akali is an assassin. Akali is meant to kill fast. The way to counter that is to play tanks/off-tanks. common sense dude. If you are playing an off-tank, get a spirit visage, if you are an adc, it is your teammates job to peel. Assassin is only an assassin if he/she can kill fast. If you make an assassin into a DOT rather than a burst champ... you destroy the fact that she is an assassin.

-------------------

Had a recent issue in game where Vi's Q would not activate. Was just wondering if this was related to the DDOS attacks. Any info is appreciated.

its been atleast 2 months, can't play between 9pm-midnight, my internet connection is fine. Is this ever gonna get fixed

Riot response : It's not our fault! It must be their 
ISP/Firewall/Router/Computer/etc. Too bad it's happening to mass amounts 
of people across the entire NA Region.Riot doesn't want to split 
up the massive NA Region yet they split up the EU. They refuse to add more 
servers to NA yet China has over a dozen server farms.Funny how 
much Riot doesn't give a **** about NA and things have been getting worse 
and worse for years. Don't expect a fix at all from them. They really 
don't care. If they did they would have fixed it by now.

-------------------

40 minutes into a game. Perfect win about to unfold. Bam Server dc. 5 minutes later of trying to log back in. Game disappears. Never received credit for the win. Thank you riot for wasting my time.

Has anyone not noticed this young man's post? 

I agree with him to some extent. I've personally had teammates lag like crazy during games. I don't know why the process woth fix this is taking so long but how can a company continue to receive "DDoS" attacks for like 8 months straight? That is ridiculous and to take just as long to continue "fighting" it while all the players suffer is just terrible. 

I've lost all my ranked games for the past few days because of major lag from unfortunate teammates and I have dropped a lot of LP because of it. Please Riot could you just give some input in the current situation and maybe an updated explanation on what is going on?

-------------------

Riot has told me to go screw myself in kind words. People dcing or not connecting is as common as buying a warding trinket.

-------------------

Thank you so much for explaining it, I've been complaining so much for the past couple weeks and I'm constantly being told it's a problem on my end. I'm actually relieved now, now that I know that you guys are addressing the problem and understand that it's actually there I can standby for a while and wait until you fix it rather than spending copious amounts of time trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist on my end

^obviously doesn't read time stamps

-------------------

So when do you think this may be fixed? Because this was posted four weeks ago, and yet it is worse than before. Please let me know if you can, I'd be grateful.

-------------------

Its always riot... Gee, we buy so much RP, what are they doing with all of our money???

-------------------

NA down? it's 5:51 est and my game is rubberbanding by 8secon margins. everyone in game having issues

-------------------

League, once again, is completely unplayable. Good God, Riot, please, stop being so pathetic.

-------------------

Just won a game and it didn't register so no LP. So glad that 1 loss negates 2 wins. I needed that win. Thanks Riot.

-------------------

This thread was made 4 weeks ago and this **** is still happening. Why is this not fixed yet, what's the holdup?

-------------------

Can anyone tell me what's going on right now? Cant connect to the game

-------------------

love this game right. Yup dcing every 2 minutes. Damn love the support and servers.

-------------------

the lag and disconnects are still happening ALL the time. you are a big company now Riot so step up and take care of your game.

-------------------

keep trying to log in and it says "server busy" i was in queue for a ranked promo game. AWESOME

-------------------

Thx Riot, I was in a game and I still got a loss when my whole team and I DC'd. Get new servers you greedy ****s

-------------------

loss forgiven is on.

-------------------

Yep... figures... winning my promotion series match and thennnnnnnnnnnnnnn.

-------------------

If you've been wondering who has and may still be doing the ddos attacks search lizardsquad on twitter. he is a menace to every server for any and all mmo's. i cant wait till he gets caught and locked up for a long time.

-------------------

I got banned last week because i was DCing in a large number of my games, that's totally my fault, that's why i keep jumping into new games and leaving (you know, for lulz).

-------------------

League of Laggage

-------------------

Ooookay I generally dont post because **** happens. But your servers **** up, and not only does my team recover, but push and win, and I get flagged for a leave? Really?!

-------------------

Yup just had three team mates d/c all game, no loss forgiven for it. So sad. Any way to contact riot to change it to loss forgiven?

Keep it up, I know how thrifty hackers can be and just ignore the d-bags that run to the forums to post about the servers being down instead of taking 2 minutes to try to reconnect to the game. (which usually works right after the server goes down)

my entire team continued to try to reconnect, then the kept disconnecting. Please don't generalize. I rarely find what you just said to be correct.

-------------------

c23dee87622ff8a9 reconnecting is why i got a leave from it. there was no 
game when i tried to reconnect. who is the d-bag? no free rp for kissing 
riot a$$.

-------------------

wow this means i can reply points

-------------------

anddddddddddddd its still broke LOL

-------------------

im done with this for a while.. between the "league of afk/and leavers" now got connection issues, and when its not me its someone else on the team..etc... loss after loss... no fun.. not to mention the utility of of these new champs... nvm.... gg's everyone... much needed break.

-------------------

I can't get into my game and i'm considering a hard reinstall. It was bad enough with the occasional AFK/Leavers in my games but now I can't connect at all. How will you tell the difference between players who has had problems even getting into the game/ reconnecting into the game/ and those players who are actual leavers and AFKers? I'm afraid that I may be reported hard, but its not like I can really tell anyone in that current game that "i'm having problems getting into the game, please don't report me, this hasn't happened the last time I played." ? I find it unfair how people may be in ranks or whatnot and might get flagged for leaving or not even connecting to the game, when its the servers faults that some players can't get in. Idk riot, there doesent seem to be a happy medium with this. I doubt loss forgiveness will catch every player experiencing difficulty in their games..

-------------------

wtf? How come I didnt get loss forgiven then?

Hey Everyone, 
Over the last couple of days, many of you have experienced some problems while playing the game. YouÂve seen reconnect spikes, issues with game starts, and very large login queue in many occasions. We wanted to take some time to give you all a little more information on whatÂs going on, since we havenÂt spoken much about this since the issues started occurring. 

In the last couple weeks our datacenter and game have been the target of some DDOS attacks. The results of these attacks have caused instability in our service. WeÂve been experiencing large attacks that have been filling up a significant chunk of bandwidth and causing parts of our system to lose connection to each other. The end result is a poor play experience for you all. While weÂve been able to turn on our loss forgiven feature as soon as the attack is detected, this does not equal a good play experience. 

While we canÂt share the details of the work we are doing internally to combat this (since it would give the attackers information to circumvent it), we want you to know that we are tackling this from many different angles. This includes working with our datacenter and internet service provider partners, as well as developing tools and services internally to make our service more robust against these types of attacks. Defending against DDOS attacks is an arms race that we will always be engaged in, and we are committed to reducing the pain you all feel as swiftly as possible when the service is being impacted by malicious attacks. 

We want you to know that this is the top priority for the Live Services team. We share your frustration at the impact of these attacks, and we are working to make sure you can play the game every time you want to. 

-Ryan 

I had a game where 3 of my teammates starts spiking and 1 just d/c and never came back. And it wasnt a loss forgiven.

-------------------

its completely ridiculous w/ the amount of money this game has not only through players, but sponsors as well that we have to put up w/ servers crapping out over and over now for months on end. its disgusting. spend some of your profit and figure it out and fix it riot. also been having ppl dc from game on and off as well as not being able to comeback as well as myself dc or complete lagouts for a minute... only 1 loss prevented in the last 3 days tho.

-------------------

I'm honestly tired of this ****. Fix the damn problem. Stop telling us what we already know and do something about it. This is honestly making me wonder why I'm playing this game  Edit: Yeah, I'm done. Nothing worse than starting 4-1, dcing for 5 minutes and then coming back and not being able to move for the next 20. I haven't been here since the beginning, but I've been playing for pretty long and even spent money on the game. It's just not something I want to support or play any longer

-------------------

I agree with b90a9630b9959bdd, I return to the game after several months (left cause of this exact reason) and bam, it's happening again. I have put a lot of money into this game so why is it that this particular server always seems to be crashing more than any others!?

-------------------

Holy ****, I bought a skin, took the RP out of my account, didn't give me the skin nor does it even say I tried to make the purchase...wtf is this!? Ok, now I'm really pissed.

-------------------

Every time i try to play a game i always lag in the most important of moments RIOT fix your f*cking servers.

-------------------

How about spending some money on the servers instead of being greedy ****s.. Thank you

Kissing ass wont make Riot fix this problem. We all need to boycott league for a week and see what happens then.

-------------------

Bullcrap excuses, Riot. You have ONE game to concentrate on and you can't even manage to keep it up and running !! I can't wait till Heroes of the Storm is available so I can ditch LOL. I USED to LOVE this game, but Riot has broken it.

-------------------

Fix your ****ty servers. I honestly cannot believe that a company that makes as much money as Riot can't manage to provide basic, stable services for your ONLY product. Stop funneling money into the Pro scene and make sure that your game functions for the VAST MAJORITY of your player base.

-------------------

Seriously Riot you own the biggest videogame in all history and you cant even ****ing fix your servers, you surely get enough money from all the skins to ensure a premium gaming experience for all players, but you instead pocket the money and dont fix the servers. Hire more people or buy a better server or whatever, just fix it, you surely have enough money, and you need to give more loss prevented, your game is so damn buggy I cant even get to the launcher because it still thinks im in a game. Fix the "Unable to connect to the server. If you have a firewall, it may be blocking the connection. Please refer to your firewall's documentation. Would you like to retry the connection?" because every knows that the ****-up is on your end, not my firewall or my router.

-------------------

I just had the game of my life. I finally mostly fixed the lag issue I was having that weren't related to East Coast difficulties and went 12-0, 320 cs and 1k gold away from full build at the 35 minute mark in ranked. Game crashes, ranked queues disabled due to server difficulties. Game not even recorded as a win/loss/leave or at all lmao.

-------------------

Yeah I'm having issues too. Everyone is freezing.  I'm not going to make a long post about the simple fact that something is wrong server side. I pray Riot fixes it, but this recent lag has been aggravating toward getting that new icon.

-------------------

I feel like people are playing to much lmao. This could be useful to take a little break since I feel that most of you are feeling stressed from ranked and that these down periods should be used to try to relax a bit

-------------------

wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again

-------------------

Personally, myself and many of my friends that I play with, have been experiencing this for more than just a few weeks. For us, this has been going on since the end of March. It has taken quite a hit on my liking of the game and I speak for my friends as well when I say that, we will likely stop playing the game if the issue is sadly left unresolved before the new year. It is sad when one of the greatest free, online games out there is getting DDOSed and their clients have to pay for it.

-------------------

well this explains a lot, good luck

Dear Riot, I do not have a degree in Business but please let me put my 2 
cents in on you how your business should be run.......1.) customer 
service.....this....doesnt exist.....you cant speak to anyone from riot 
within 48 hours...2.) pay attention to the small person who spends 
5-10 dollars a week, him times 500k+ is what runs your company....and 
his friends that he brings into the game that wind up buyin a couple 
characters and skins......not a group of 5 asian kids who play games for 
a living, you're not making any money off of them...everyone has already 
heard of your game, and it's horrible stability issues...3.) how 
much money do you really make? you should have an amount of servers that 
equals blizzard or higher...4.) higher some damned security, how 
bout take lizard squad, and pay them what they want to; to secure your 
servers, they got in, they know how to stop it....hire some hackers and 
put some damned securities in place....5.) get rid of 
00d48f62e5b339fd, hes useless, we all saw what he did to WoW.....

you know guys Dota 2 doesnt ever have as many or as serious lag issues, maybe even give smite a shot. Also why not go for adventure time battle party if you like that cartoon. just some suggestions ya know to get away from this game all together(if you're having lag issues that is). i mean riot has made it very apparent that they could care less about East NA service. like many others have mentioned this problem hasnt just surfaced it has literally been going on since March after one of their patches(but it also doesnt help with the lizardf**s ddos'ing every few hours for the LULz). As many people that play this game and as much money as im sure riot makes it warms my heart to know that a company as big as they are at this point in the franchise cant afford to get some GD dedicated servers to hold up ONE game. get a hold of Blizzard, maybe they can give you some pointers riot. you know cuz they have multiple games with dedicated servers and they're all mmos which through experience i have never seen such atrocious lag/server issues as i have with this game.  -sincerely very disgruntled individual

-------------------

Pry will give Smite a shot with all the **** I have been experiencing here, especially from coming back to it. If the servers and the DDOS-ing doesn't seem to be fixed by the end of the week I'm done with this game. Seriously even MWO from PGI doesn't seem to have this many issues and they're based in freaking canada.

credentials in working with huge companies.

-------------------

my friends and I's ranked team can't even play because we are scared to, frankly. And everytime we do, someone lags out on one of the teams. We started decaying because we never play any more. It's just not fun when it becomes a crapshoot of "who's going to make it until the end". It even affects individual rank. This season should almost have an asterisk by it.

-------------------

I haven't gotten a loss prevented yet I have been disconnecting when I have perfect connection... Riot lost me about 5 games in ranked, I guess I don't get plat this season.. 2-1 in series then losses because of riot and no loss forgiven

-------------------

Regarding recent instability , there is no stability.

-------------------

Took 3 force disconnects from watching a circle loading on a black screen and 2 computer restarts to unfreeze my comp, JUST to get into a game.  THEN, it was running in place, freezing, disconnecting, spells going off 10 seconds after activation, and just APPEARING in various spots that you and others weren't a moment before.  THIS IS NO LONGER A PLAYABLE GAME!!!

-------------------

"Top priority"  well you should maintain keeping it a "top priority" not just hey it's fixed let's wait till it crashes again....  seriosuly 3 DCs in 1 game of 42 minutes is just ridiculous !

-------------------

Moootherrr****eeeerrs!!!!!!!

-------------------

Ya I switched to LAN. So much better. Here in Boston btw. In NA I was getting 108ping steady and on LAN Im at 50ping and you can just feel the difference is beautiful   **** Riot for just never giving East Coast anything but at least I found the loophole.

-------------------

I really enjoy playing this game.. I really do. But as of about two weeks ago I have begun missing playing. At least 1 out of every 5 games has serious lag issues, and on top of that I get to spend about 5-10 minutes at least 1 out of every 10 games trying to reconnect or constantly opening and closing League Client just to get back into the game. This is totally unacceptable. I for one am embarrassed for Riot. League of Legends has the stability of a rodeo bull in a circus!

Hey Everyone, 
Over the last couple of days, many of you have experienced some problems while playing the game. YouÂve seen reconnect spikes, issues with game starts, and very large login queue in many occasions. We wanted to take some time to give you all a little more information on whatÂs going on, since we havenÂt spoken much about this since the issues started occurring. 

In the last couple weeks our datacenter and game have been the target of some DDOS attacks. The results of these attacks have caused instability in our service. WeÂve been experiencing large attacks that have been filling up a significant chunk of bandwidth and causing parts of our system to lose connection to each other. The end result is a poor play experience for you all. While weÂve been able to turn on our loss forgiven feature as soon as the attack is detected, this does not equal a good play experience. 

While we canÂt share the details of the work we are doing internally to combat this (since it would give the attackers information to circumvent it), we want you to know that we are tackling this from many different angles. This includes working with our datacenter and internet service provider partners, as well as developing tools and services internally to make our service more robust against these types of attacks. Defending against DDOS attacks is an arms race that we will always be engaged in, and we are committed to reducing the pain you all feel as swiftly as possible when the service is being impacted by malicious attacks. 

We want you to know that this is the top priority for the Live Services team. We share your frustration at the impact of these attacks, and we are working to make sure you can play the game every time you want to.

I live in central usa which has the worst ping in the usa (100+ when east coast sits at 80ish but that's not the point). The point is my region is always effected the hardest. 2+ weeks ago I started noticing in game that spells weren't casting. Then the d/cs started. Then prisoner's island came.

-------------------

Why can't it just tell us what our ping will be before we enter games? I just tried to play out an entire game averaging 500 ping. I would have just played a co-op or skipped playing at all had I known.

go to your start menu on your computer , type cmd then type ping 
http://www.leagueoflegends.com , it will tell you the ping of your CURRENT connection , could change seconds after or be steady all day. i don't know a software that can predict ping extremely accurately sorry

will admit , took me a few trys to get it successfully. but over all good idea to do before a game make sure servers ares stable ish. or just check forums , normaly within half a second of a server issue the forms becomes a wild fire of rage XD

-------------------

Hey scum riot fix your damn servers its everyday now

-------------------

so 8/10 of our players are d/cd, including me. Rip o7

-------------------

Honestly, they've had these same problems SINCE BETA.  With several BILLION DOLLARS you think they'd upgrade their servers......

-------------------

Is this drop hacking? Second time in two days where it happened when I was winning. What's going on.

-------------------

Rito Everytime you do this to me why

-------------------

Just DC'd xD

-------------------

Just pooped on me too, thought it was my wireless. lol  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFaT_3yrIR4

-------------------

just wow :P

-------------------

RIOT.....FIX YOUR GODDAM ****. 4 weeks this has been going on. This is unacceptable. I'm seriously about ready to call my bank and tell them that you have removed access to my account materials and request chargebacks. It is getting ridiculous that every night, the servers **** themselves. That every night, were unable to play because you cant' or won't spend the money required to provide a stable service to paying customers.  Edit: I wouldn't care if servers were down for maintenance, or you told us ahead of time that servers would be down for some reason. It is this bull**** spotty service, with no explanation, no response, no acknowledgement from Riot that pisses me off. How do they not have a twitter page or a community manager who can pop on and say "hey guys, were getting hacked/DDOS'd/WHATEVER, were working to fix it thanks." We get dick, and it is annoying.

-------------------

wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again wow again

-------------------

riot why you do this?? I haven't played in like 3 hours.

-------------------

So EVERYONE that was in a game got dced? Or is it just me.

-------------------

****ing hell

-------------------

Good thing that the lag happened right as I joined a ranked game and it was a 4v1 most of the game. Thanks Riot for also counting it as a loss.

-------------------

Yeah we had the same thing. Three of us disconnected at a crucial point, they won, and it counted as a defeat.My friend got demoted off it. Wow, Riot. At least have these games be loss prevented.

-------------------

So I just got back on after an unresolved 14 day ban, and the very first 
ranked match I play in all day, I get stuck with some Kayle 
(summoner name is 9df46510e286b62a, this particular 
match he went 2/11/1 in 26 minutes apparently - it's in my match 
history) who gets wrecked by the enemy Annie and then gives up and 
threatens to go afk, and instead just decided to troll our 
team. Then, out of nowhere, I get dc'd with a constant "attempting 
to reconnect" message (similar to the drop-hacking that was 
supposedly going on a while back) and never got reconnected ( so I was 
assuming I got drop-hacked by that worthless Kayle, 9df46510e286b62a).So 
as a last resort - because I really didn't want to 
leave the match since it was a ranked match and I was doing pretty well 
in my previous matches, and also due to my recent unresolved ban - I 
completely closed the client while the match was still going since I was 
left with apparently no other choice and upon attempting to log back in 
it tells me I can't because the "servers are busy" 
and to "try again later." If I get reported for being afk 
in my match because your server messed up and you ban me again, or 
because that Kayle (9df46510e286b62a 
- and yes I keep repeating his-her name because I didn't get to report 
the the little troll at the end of the match) decided to be an 
uber-troll and drop-hack me to get me into some serious sh*t because it 
was a ranked match, I will raise mortal hell on GD.

-------------------

gj riot keep up the good work

-------------------

guys the attackers are probably using some kind of multiplication attack like with NTP or DNS   these attacks are very hard to deal with as they can easily saturate the network inputs

-------------------

Well I can't even check if my game is still going on or it's counted as a loss or win. When I attempt to relog, it just says server is busy bull****.

so then just disable the game because apparently the DDoS hackers are smarter then the ppl u guys hired. this will obviously continue to happen cuz they just get worst and worst. disable the game and send out a mass email when u guys get this **** figured out. your a company that fails about 5 times a week.

-------------------

So it's pretty upsetting when getting d/c'd from a game in which I was 6/1/3 counts as a leave...especially when it's ranked.

-------------------

Lost promos. Did most damage in game tho #wurf

Gaddamnit! Imma go eat dinner instead... =.=''

But what if? All the server jump or skip cause all of the players on Wednesday night, but what if riot is dedicated to get all the servers back up all there tech and support jumps into action(lol I said support)trying to fix the problem and what if there so busy, concentrated and determined to fix the problem they don't even think to waste time to tell us there's a problem. You clearly know there's a problem. I think your looking at this the wrong way.

-------------------

Please fix, I was about to go into Ranked Game Spree mode with my friend but nooo.. ): I need to get to Gold nowwww! D:

-------------------

Ok, so I'm playing some normals with my friends, then the server acts up. The servers were still incosistent, and disconnected me after 9 minutes. I think "well, it's reasonable to expect this to not count towards leaverbuster" When I connect 2 hours later, I get no message about me being in any kind of risk. I try to play again, and once again I get disconnected. I try to reconnect, and i find im banned until September 25th. Now, it's only a day(and my b-day as well), however it's ridicolous that people are being punished due to server incosistency. Now, in general my internet connection is incosistent, however it never acts up so much within such a short timefram.

-------------------

Oh nice i can log in but the queue doe

-------------------

No loss prevented wtf

-------------------

Just lost a ranked game because 3 people on my team DC'd for 10 min. The enemy team also had 3 DC's but they rejoined relatively quickly. No loss forgiven. I understand that things cant be perfect 24/7 but enabling loss forgiven after the damage is done helps absolutely no body. I hope for my LP back, but It's pointless, you guys don't seem to care about any-one under diamond. Kinda weak.

-------------------

What is sad is when you spend your hard earned money on a game to get things to only get disconnects....busy server...long loggins..... Leave status on a game you didn't leave.... cant get back in the game cause it crashes and now your suggestion is to check my firewall???? Please RIOT it is getting to the point that I don't even want to bother hassling with frustrations. I am sure it is not your intent for this ..it just seems that every time you guys do an update the game has nothing but issues with game play.

Look I don't know whose attacking the server, but I've honestly had enough of this **** I don't care who it is it needs to stop it's ****ing bull**** why would someone ****ing do this **** to begin it's a waste of time it's pissing off plenty of people and it's just plain ****ing childish for someone to go out of their way to make others(RIOT and Summoners) angry and pissed, because of these stupid attacks.

-------------------

Pretty sure no one of importance will read this, but I just have to get this off my chest.  I'm a new father who works 2 jobs to support his family. I get very little time to myself, and when I do, I like to play League of Legends. I used to play all the time before I had my son, but now I obviously have more important things to do. I get to play maybe once or twice a week for a couple hours at best. Every single time I log to play, this happens. It makes it impossible to feel any kind of enjoyment from this game when you get disconnected or the server goes down every single time you try to play. It's been going on for a long time now, and frankly, I'm about done. I've spent hundreds of dollars on this game and now I wish I hadn't because obviously the money you guys make just isn't being appropriated to the things that matter. I'm glad you can release a new patch and make new champions every other week, but how about you fix the internal issues with the actual playability of the game first? Who cares about a new champion if you can't even play him?   I've been playing league for about 3 years now and I've seen you guys start to care less and less about the player experience over all. When you were a little **** company you did everything you could to make us happy and to get more people to play the game. Now that you are bigtime and making that fat cash, it's **** the little guy. "Who cares if they quit, we got millions more!"  I read a post on reddit today with someone asking when people will move on from League of Legends, and all I could think was, with the server instability and inability to play, I can see people moving on from league pretty soon. Who wants to waste their time looking at an attempting to reconnect message every time they try to play. Not this guy. I sincerely hope you fix your problems with whatever it is you can't stop with the DDOS or whatever, for your sake and mine.

Your time is up league of legends you are getting useless. It is time to try dota 2

-------------------

I just finished a ranked game that I got kicked out of by lag, the game was finished in an unfair 3v2 match up, my duo que partner won it, and everyone else did not get a loss prevented or any other compensation. How does riot expect any sort of ranked play to happen if people who are trying to get into higher tiers cant because your servers force game shut downs? I dont feel ranked game rewarding is fair if people trying to get those rewards cant because of forced game shut downs.

I just finished a ranked game that I got kicked out of by lag, the game was finished in an unfair 3v2 match up, my duo que partner won it, and everyone else did not get a loss prevented or any other compensation. How does riot expect any sort of ranked play to happen if people who are trying to get into higher tiers cant because your servers force game shut downs? I dont feel ranked game rewarding is fair if people trying to get those rewards cant because of forced game shut downs. 

I feel your frustration. I can only a play once or twice a week and it's hard enough to get wins as it is without having to worry about the server problems. It's just pointless to play ranked any more. Even when you win one game, you lose the next because of disconnects or server issues.

-------------------

I was in the last game of my promotional series with my duo partner and the game froze saying "attempting to recconnect" for the both of us. After 5 mins. I tried to re-loggin and got a 5 min. que. Once I got onto the server I received a message saying you have been unsuccessful in your series. I was hoping to get a "loss prevention", how do I go about getting this corrected?

Your servers went down and I was disconnected from a game. When I was finally able to log back in around 20 minutes later, my match history shows a leave. There is even a notification on the front page after you log in that states there are server issues and loss prevention has been enabled. Why do I have a leave on my record and why wasn't the match loss prevented? We were winning that game so it's doubly frustrating to not only get my victory and LP, but now I get hit with a leave. I'm a paying player of this game, but even if I wasn't this is not acceptable. Your servers have been experiencing issues for the past month and now I'm being punished for it. What gives?

Ok. So when are East coast players going to be back down to 70 ping again? I've been sitting at 130-160 ever since those problems you were having in February. I know Australian players who get better connection to NA than I do. The 6 or 7 people I play with all had a similar spike at the same time and it's lasted until now.

SO I was in a ranked game, and won the game and it concluded. THEN the servers exploded.  When I got back in, my LP didnt go up +5 (To reach 100) and then I was forced to relog into the client, at which point the server somehow now believes I am connected to a game.  Guess I will be stuck in a ghost game, which I didnt even queue for, for the remainder of the night.

-------------------

Hey, riot i sincerely hope you read this. I was just in a ranked game and lost because of lag issues (Plus being forced into a champion i don't know, but that is another story). This resulted in me also losing my series. Now I've been reading a lot about you not caring about anyone not diamond+. I am bronze 4. To my defense ( But I'm sure you heard this a lot ) I don't honestly think i deserve too be in bronze so for the last 3 days (Just recently started playing ranked) I've been dealing with troll, little kids, and ragers (albeit i rage every so often too lol!!). Just too finally get a shot at my series. My first game two people got disconnected. My second game we won. The third game how ever was laggy, and we lost. So i get Disconnected and try to reconnect. It tells me too check my firewall. We both know that my firewall is not the issue here. I guess to get to the point loss prevented SHOULD be retroactive. It was really disheartening to have too deal with so much **** too just get a SHOT at moving up in the world, then have it all come crashing down on your head because of these issues. I guess I could beg for another chance at me series, but i'm sure everyone will read this and say bronze 4 lol n00b. However not everyone that plays your game are pro's, and it really blows that the little man is the one that suffers the most in these cases. Now im not saying diamond or even gold+ are not affected by this but, from my understanding, it is a lot easier for them too find teams that have good communication, skill, and teamwork. Where as in bronze 4 I feel like i literally drag myself through hell just to get a shot at going too bronze 3 (lol). I guess I am just fed up with playing with the lower end of the skill totem pole, and after finally getting a chance too play with better players it really blows that I'm stuck dragging myself through the bronze player pool too get another chance lol. Well, i really hope someone at riot took the time too read this. I also hope they understand our pain and frustration. With that I'm off too cry myself too sleep haha.

-------------------

I was in the last game of my promotional series with my duo partner and the game froze saying "attempting to recconnect" for the both of us. After 5 mins. I tried to re-loggin and got a 5 min. que. Once I got onto the server I received a message saying you have been unsuccessful in your series. I was hoping to get a "loss prevention", how do I go about getting this corrected?

I was in the last game of my promotional series with my duo partner and the game froze saying "attempting to recconnect" for the both of us. After 5 mins. I tried to re-loggin and got a 5 min. que. Once I got onto the server I received a message saying you have been unsuccessful in your series. I was hoping to get a "loss prevention", how do I go about getting this corrected? 

Pretty much my problem as well lol!

-------------------

i usually don't say anything on the forums when **** like this happens..but the thing is...you guys get attacked WAY too often, it's absurd how often you guys are the subject to these attacks. I don't hear dota2, dawngate, heroes of the storm, strife or any other moba having this issue. Granted they are all run by different companies with different hardware/software, servers etc etc etc. I think you guys need to team up with some of the other companies and figure out why they arent being attacked or if they are being attacked find out how they recover so quickly that their forums arent full of raging teenagers.

-------------------

What's going on, it keeps saying "Did not receive a response from the server; retrying". I haven't done anything different - I haven't messed with my firewall, antivirus, etc - and it doesn't appear as though anyone else is having this issue. Is there a fix?

-------------------

I had enough riot you took my teamates away and you dont give me a lost prevention seriously, this is bs

-------------------

ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ Free 1K RP or Riot ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ

-------------------

I understand that you guys have issues with servers. I get that but at least you could use loss forgiven if everyone in game is kicked then you log in just in time to read DEFEAT across your screen. I loss LP for that ****...there has to be a way that Loss Forgiven can be set it when a whole group in a single game gets kicked and cant reconnect in time due to server busy errors!

-------------------

and now we wait....over 20k

-------------------

It is pretty funny about the inconsistency of the server up-time. Doubt they're all DDOS attacks. A friend of mine just got in even though the queue was screwed up. So, don't fret, just keep trying.   Or come back later and try because you may keep getting discd. ;o

-------------------

I swear to God, Riot, you better give some retrograde Loss Prevented or you're going to have some very angry customers. It's stuff like this that prevents me from spending actual money on this game. Not worth it.

-------------------

Was angry for the dc - but then i saw loss prevented. Thanks Riot <3

-------------------

Give me back my lp riot. Wth

-------------------

As I'm sure everyone knows, these problems are still happening. While I can appreciate that Riot and Co. are working to resolve these issues, I would appreciate it even more if Riot could also deal with ensuring loss prevention for Ranked Games when disconnection issues occur. I am not saying that every time a member disconnects should the losing team have their loss prevented. But when an entire team or both teams disconnect for an extended amount of time, I would hope that in Ranked games, this wouldn't be a punishable offense. It isn't always poor Internet connections that cause us to disconnect. I understand that there's a lot going on behind the scenes, but I'm a gamer not a member of tech support. I play this game, because I love it. Over the past 2+ years myself and friends (one of whom was also in this game with me) have spent hundreds of dollars on purchasing RP. I know we don't have to do that and this game is free to play, but we enjoy it. I especially enjoy it more since I have recently started playing Ranked. Until stuff like this happens, and it's happening more and more. It doesn't just affect me and the people I know who play, but people I have met through this game has been affected. This may be a stupid game to some, but it is so much more for other people. It helped me relieve stress while I was finishing up my college degree and kept me company when I couldn't sleep. I'm not a great player by far, so when I'm on a three game win streak, it's exciting for me. To have the streak broken because my entire team and the entire enemy team disconnected (while we were making a significant comeback might I add) and the enemy team had more members reconnect before us, allowing them to rush mid for the win. So it was disheartening to say the least to have the very minor winning streak broken, but to also not receive a loss prevention AND to lose league points for a loss that was out of any member of my team's keyboard? That is unnecessary. This happened to five people that I know of (members of my team) and who knows how many other games this affected. The disabled ranked queues and loss preventions were established less than 3 minutes after our game ended. So why do the other games get loss preventions? Is their time or money more important than mine? I've tried looking for a place to report something like this, but this discussion board is the only place I have found to try and get word to anyone who could do anything about this. It would be nice if there was something permanent that we could report these occurrences to, so that they may be reviewed or however this stuff works. I apologize for my lack of knowledge on the processes. But I won't accept your apologies for having problems like these with no solutions. All of the other instances that I know have happened for a fact during Ranked games are too long to add to this post.  In Summary: I am very disappointed in you Riot, your way of fixing things isn't very productive. I could live with the disconnections if there was something you were doing on your end to make it right such as loss prevention. That's all I'm asking for. Take care of your dedicated players, and we will keep paying to play this "free-to-play" game. Thanks for reading...

I just finished a ranked game that I got kicked out of by lag, the game was finished in an unfair 3v2 match up, my duo que partner won it, and everyone else did not get a loss prevented or any other compensation. How does riot expect any sort of ranked play to happen if people who are trying to get into higher tiers cant because your servers force game shut downs? I dont feel ranked game rewarding is fair if people trying to get those rewards cant because of forced game shut downs. 

Same thing happened in my game. My partner and I were on a losing team. Please fix the issues Riot.Loss Prevention isn't hard.

-------------------

Thanks for the efforts!

-------------------

When the hell will you fix the firewall errors?

-------------------

Riot, what the heck is going on? Is it DDOS attacks again, or is it something different this time? I mean come on, this is ridiculous.   I have been playing since 2009 and only now am I having any sort of issue with connection. Even back a year or two ago when the servers were basically down for an entire month, I was still able to play games without any issues. But now, even I am having issues with connection.  What the heck is going on with your servers? Or is it the ISP that is having issues?

Update: I would currently be going into a promo series on a 4 game winning streak, if I had received a rightful loss prevention.

-------------------

same ****, different night guarantee it'll happen again like clockwork at 9 PM EST

-------------------

=( Wish riot would hear our pleas and make it right. Surely they could take every game an hour or so before the crash and systematically give them all loss prevented, or as one member commented win granted. Sadly as often as this happens if they did that everyone would be in diamond lol.

-------------------

my account got ban today because they say I was leaving to many games but every single time I play I always random d/c I don't have these problems playing smite or any other game so how is it my fault that I get ban cause riot cant fix there broke ass servers

-------------------

my account got banned for the same reason to many leaves but im not leavinng your servers crash or wont let us connect and yet i get banned why is your leave buster on how times you leave instead of how many games you play to how many are left.... this is making me not even want to play this game anymore bc im getting punished bc you cant keep stable severs and you wont unban anyone after admitting that ppl are getting banned and losing promos for your fault either turn leave buster off until you can fix your servers or unban people this is getting retarded....

-------------------

Bull**** loss forgiven is turned on as soon as the attack is detected. Was about to win a game (pushing towards nexus after ace) and our whole team dcs and we come back to our nexus popping.  Fantastic stuff

-------------------

-took ages to login.  -reconnects and kicked out of loading screen.  -reconnects again, in-game random dc and 'attempting to reconnect'.  -reconnected, game finished got tons of report.  -plays again to make amends. deja vu!!!.  -account suspended.  -wrote a ticket to support -"I'm sorry to hear about your connection issues."  well played.

-------------------

what else is new non stop lag again for the 3rd day in a row

-------------------

how about we release a patch where the servers actually work!

-------------------

Stupid reconnecting keeps losing me games and ip, hurry the hell up

-------------------

Ever since LCS and the constant push towards esports Riots server stability has dropped dramatically. Learn from other large companies on how to handle these issues and pursue those. Stop trying to take on this "self drawn responsibility" to be the driver of esports and work on what brought you to where you are today.

-------------------

Why don't you get on your **** and put on loss prevented?

-------------------

At this point I'm owed 5 ****ing games because of this.

-------------------

such waste of time now..won't even bother doing anything if i get banned for this lag..cuz i won't be coming back..there are lots of better games out there now..especially with a shhitttyyy server..this game might not last any longer..

-------------------

What can we do to help with this?

-------------------

I'm so sick of this. Over the last three months,I've probably had 7-10 games where my team disconnects and i come back to see the enemy team at our nexus winning the game. I've poured tons of hours and money into the game, and I'm really becoming irate with the lack of ability to come home and play a fair game. I'm tired of losing LP due to unfair advantages because of connectivity issues.  If i have to pay 5$ a month to subscribe to help Riot keep up with servers I would.

-------------------

So server dropped me, ranked is disabled and i lost the match with no loss prevention, why? Losing LP for being a bad player is one thing but losing LP for dropped servers is frustrating. IS it possible to get the LP back? I normally wouldn't care but I cant stand low rank, its filled with trolls and people who dont know how to play.  I

-------------------

It seems like these issues have been going on for a while now, with so many players, and so many servers, and a global game with this much recognition, you would think some of riots money could be put back into the game in the form of service security, not so much into cool videos and stuff. As much as we appreciate these things, at the core of it all, we are here to play the game; for the experience, the competition, etc. When you spend 40+ minutes playing a hard fought game, trying to win your last promo match and you finally get that victory it really sucks to see that it never registers because you disabled ranked queues during the game.

-------------------

I stopped playing LoL about 2-3 weeks back because of the nonstop connection problems (honestly I should have done it earlier but it was summer and I was bored). I come back today to maintain my ranking and to check if the servers are healthy and what happens? I disconnect, my bot lane disconnects, and my mid laner and jungler have to 2v4 (since the opposing team apparently had a single dc). We all managed to reconnect ~5 minutes later and were greeted by a one sided slaughter for our efforts.  I dread having to play this game again in 2-3 weeks to keep my LP from deteriorating. While loss prevention is nice, it is absolute torture (slight exaggeration I suppose) to play ranked, or this game in general, under these conditions. If it wasn't for the Morgana skin I would probably just not return until next season, if at all.  Yes, I realize Riot is not to blame for DDoS attacks but that still can't make me grit my teeth and keep playing the game like I used to.

-------------------

Lag again in so cal?

-------------------

As a long time player of league let me just tell you how thoroughly disappointed I am in the current state of your server instability. I don't honestly know how many times I've tried to just play a single game and get disconnected, only to log back in and have an extended wait time to join another lobby. I understand your working on the issue, but for people like me who just wanna enjoy the and for what it is, find this completely asinine to battle your servers more often then the enemy team. Find a soil solution soon or you will lose a fan. Good job on the game, but the instability has made it poor and completely worthless to many in your home country.

I sincerely doubt this has 
anything to do with DDOS attacks. 

They bring out Azir, the game turns into lag and disconnect hell. 
They have the silly world sports cup opening page, it works "better". 
They bring back the Azir opening page, it goes to HELL again. 
They roll back to the silly world cup thing, it works better again. Not perfect, but better. 

I don't for a second believe this is all anything BUT programming they've broken somewhere over time. 
That's how so many games go... Zynga did it with Petville... it was so old, but they just kept adding stuff until there were conflicts in programming, making it nearly unusable. 
IMVU is another social thing that's full of bugs, glitches and slowdown too... they love blaming it on the users, saying their settings or comps are somehow inadequate. 

And here's Riot, taking the easy way out and saying they're under attack from evil hacker types. 

It's all so not very credible. On a side note, i DO like seeing glitches, when they're visual. It's entertaining somehow when you see mana bars on the left side of the screen starting to extend 25% beyond the borders of the team mate portraits. It's also interesting to see characters running in slow motion, so you can get to see animation frames which normally go by too fast. 

After a few minutes though, you just want to squat over your computer and take a massive dump, walking away from it for days. .....And that's bad, it's not your comp's fault. 
It's Riot, dedicating their resources to stupid ass eSports instead of cool stuff and stability.

-------------------

Start ddosing the hackers back? No, not joking. Most are out of country so not illegal. Hire some new talent?

-------------------

Won't happen. Riot's model would always have a loophole open.

-------------------

sooo just played a game ,well im still in it actually and like everyone is dropped and its like 3v2 with the hardest lag EVER

-------------------

its ****ed i had same thing happen!

-------------------

What is wrong with you riot get your **** together na is so ****ed up holy **** unplayable done with this game until you learn something about running it

-------------------

Well we can't do anything about it. Just let Riot try to figure out a solution to the problem. I bet theyre trying hard to find ways to negate the attacks...

-------------------

Havent been able to play in weeks because the constant lag spikes.

-------------------

I am having issues where my patcher is saying it is unable to install. i have done repair and reinstall. no luck anyone else having this issue?

-------------------

this game is like so good. Dont we all love the dcing and losing ranks cause of this. Damn lets go watch the pros play while we cant play

-------------------

server so bad its making me get cancer. Damn negate the lag the only thing they negating is people form playing this game

-------------------

I would like to say that on many occasions in the last month i have tried to be very patient with trying to download the updates. since i havent been able to play for quite some time. and, its all the same constant shenanigans to be honest. i am unable to download it, after deleting it from my software and everything. its so frustrating because, in 3 months its all you want to play. maybe, message me with some other options. cause, very soon im not going to want to play lol anymore or at all. not to be rude but, instead of upgrading the champs and creating more maybe you should have fixed the bugs and threats that your having, just a suggestion. its very frustrating especially when youve tried to redownload the game 87 times and it doesnt go past 37% on the second stage. after playing all day everyday, any gamer is going to try and be easy going about this whole situation.

-------------------

Well cause of these lagg spikes causeing my game to crash/disconnect on the NA server the leave buster has pinged my account to many times so when i left 1 game becuase of the dicks on my team being to heavy to play with i get banned now for 7 days, this is the first match i have left because of my own choice in like 2 weeks if not longer, any games i have been pinged for leaving before today were not of my own choice, the server crashed from huge lag spikes from live patching or from to many people exceeding the log in stress limit.

Don't even go to support requests. The support is garbage and doesn't 
even do anything with this lag / instability. They are useless they even 
said it wasn't my fault yet they can't do anything about it.Hey 
Summoner,Thank you for contacting League of Legends player 
support. This is 7f46ec03a0054aae and I will be your support specialist 
for today!First of all, I want to say that I hear you - losing your 
game is not easy to swallow, especially if it's outside of your control.On 
the other hand, I know that disconnects, dodges, and losses sometimes 
happen for reasons beyond your control.The ÂLoss PreventedÂ that 
sometimes appears in match history is only applied during server-wide 
instability or lag. We canÂt apply Loss Prevented to individual matches.Unfortunately, 
our system does not allow modification of leaves, losses, or Elo. The 
system was built this way in an effort to prevent corruption. We are,

well the thing is between the times the game experiences these server issues i play alot of matchs but they dont seem to be effecting the standing with leave buster in an average day for me i can play around 8-10 match's/games, and it feels about every weekend/tuesdays theirs server issues cause of either a patch or live maintenance, so when i play a match on those "hot" days i experience server connection issues so i log out and try to log back in and most times i takes restarting the league client 2-3 times well other times i have to run the client repair program to make sure no files disappeared cause of the servers issues, and leave buster seems to pick up on those attempts to connect to the match and ad them to the counter that it runs for match's left, so what im trying to point out is that people are being punished for servers giving them the boot from their games cause they cant handle the load factor if live maintence and such cause it cause's so many people huge lag spikes they all are loging out and back in and when you have a few hundred thousand people logging in around the same time it cause even more server instability which in turn creates more server lag spikes for other people.

-------------------

Thanks for Trying to fix this problem guys, it has been a really Tough week for league and i hope to see all the DDOS attackers give up on This. I don't understand why they even do it.

-------------------

im guessing riot has noticed the text bug on kogmaws name in the champ page he appears first with stars befor his name and in game his name is bugged

-------------------

still having these problems with me and my teammates

-------------------

Is this why my buddy can't make an account?

-------------------

I never knew 15k ping is possible

op ping.png

-------------------

This isn't even fun anymore. People just rage over d/c's and fight and complain. Meanwhile, each game is plagued with this **** and theres never a "good game. I'm so sick and tired of this and i cannot climb because of the d/c's. There is so much riot wont do like fix the freakin bug splats. Oh well. there goes my plat hopes =\

-------------------

Ok Riot, "we have turned on the loss forgiven feature", right, now twice i have lost a ranked match because of being DC'ed every time I tried to reconnect to the game and every time it was a loss, no forgiveness, I'm pretty much at the point of not even bothering with the game anymore, you would think after 4 or so years that things would be pretty much solved. I apologize if I come across too direct with my frustrations

-------------------

Still find it funny that this thread is stickied but after they created it many weeks ago and posted 5 times, they never gave us another update.  If they don't want to give us updates, at least unsticky this thread.

-------------------

me and my teammates kept disconnecting every few mins...this has been happening for the past week...no lost prevented... i was demoted 2 divisions over the past week because of it... at least shut down ranked and fix the problem. it is extremely frustrating to have ranked go down for 1 problem then come back with even worse bugs, sure i dont have ping spikes or frame drops but now my game crashes every 10mins

-------------------

http://www.twitch.tv/zxprimalxz

what

-------------------

Is this still happening? because im getting EXACTLY what they are stating in the thread, but its already been over a month...

-------------------

then why are the servers online i suggest that u ppl shut down the servers and fix the problem instead of keeping the server online and ppl playing with high pings. it has always been the same with this game when ever there is a problem u ppl make sure the servers are online and making a mess of things. shut it down fix the problem and the get the servers back online IS IT THAT HARD?

It is when money is involved. Name of the game is we just don't play ranked. It is unfortunate, but that is the way it is. I lost my last ranked due to the same thing, I'm just running team builder now. Don't want to lose due to a disconnected ADC again, or literally about to win and then I get kicked

Ya might help but then people are waiting for the servers to be back up and might start a new game making them lose "Money"

-------------------

No update? Cmon Riot

"Over the last couple of months*"  fixed for you sir.

-------------------

Oh look, it's happening again  SO glad I was going positives before and then hit two big 0-fers in a row. Fawking DDOS

-------------------

Can we get and update on this? just lost two games because of constant dc'ing from myself and others. I was expecting a loss forgiven for at least my second game but nope nothing. Not going to lie pretty salty because i was one win away from my promos and im trying to beat my friend to Plat lol

-------------------

its lagging again..

-------------------

Awesome that I can't connect to the game. Was at the loading screen and random game has crashed comes up. So awesome Riot.

-------------------

I just got disconnected from a ranked game. We were probably going to win. I'm very frustrated and did not receive a loss forgiven.

-------------------

Dear Riot,   While we all understand that it's got to be pretty hard running a giant server the way you do, that doesn't make it any easier on us, the players. Especially when a lot of us have spent not only time but rather large chunks of money on buying the various skins, champions, icons and wards. The least you could do is give us the loss prevented we deserve considering many of us are losing matches purely because our team mates are dc'ing without any control.  You know it is a server issue and you've said you want to fix it but it doesn't seem like much has been done. Instead, what we see is you releasing new champions, new skins and reworks for a lot of the older champions. And while this is much appreciated (usually), right now really isn't the best time to be doing those things. It honestly seems like you're only saying you'll fix it to appease us temporarily. And it's becoming quite aggravating.  I may only be one person, but I believe that I speak for a large percentage of the community when I say that you're kinda failing us right now, Riot.  Sincerely,  A Very Dissatisfied Player

-------------------

Started ranked game. Everyone got "Attempting to Reconnect" messages then our entire team dropped. I know at least a few of the members of the other team did as well. WTF Riot.

Hey Everyone, 
Over the last couple of days, many of you have experienced some problems while playing the game. YouÂve seen reconnect spikes, issues with game starts, and very large login queue in many occasions. We wanted to take some time to give you all a little more information on whatÂs going on, since we havenÂt spoken much about this since the issues started occurring. 

In the last couple weeks our datacenter and game have been the target of some DDOS attacks. The results of these attacks have caused instability in our service. WeÂve been experiencing large attacks that have been filling up a significant chunk of bandwidth and causing parts of our system to lose connection to each other. The end result is a poor play experience for you all. While weÂve been able to turn on our loss forgiven feature as soon as the attack is detected, this does not equal a good play experience. 

While we canÂt share the details of the work we are doing internally to combat this (since it would give the attackers information to circumvent it), we want you to know that we are tackling this from many different angles. This includes working with our datacenter and internet service provider partners, as well as developing tools and services internally to make our service more robust against these types of attacks. Defending against DDOS attacks is an arms race that we will always be engaged in, and we are committed to reducing the pain you all feel as swiftly as possible when the service is being impacted by malicious attacks. 

We want you to know that this is the top priority for the Live Services team. We share your frustration at the impact of these attacks, and we are working to make sure you can play the game every time you want to.

They should just close shop on North America and only have League of Legends available to regions of the world where it runs in an acceptable manner.

-------------------

So it is happening again...any word on when it will be fixed? Or even what the possible solutions are?

-------------------

Hey everyone,  As some of you may have heard, the Tribunal is a system that addresses many types of player behaviors but is currently in extended maintenance while we upgrade a lot of the core functionality. You can read more about it here: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/upgrading-tribunal  In the meantime, we've launched several test systems that have begun aggressively reducing negative player behaviors in League of Legends including a system with the ability to instantly escalate high severity behaviors such as excessive verbal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and worse to a 14-day or permanent ban. After several weeks of testing in North America, we are now ready to start these tests on the European servers. We'll continue to monitor the results of these tests as we prepare to roll them out in other regions.  The reason I'm here today though, is because while these systems are effective at reducing negative verbal behaviors in League, we've been working on ways to address negative gameplay behaviors in League.  Starting 8/26/2014 in North America, weÂll be rolling out a test system capable of immediately escalating extreme intentional feeders straight to a 14-day or permanent ban. Like our other punishment systems, weÂll start with conservative tests to minimize false positives, and then expand the system to be more aggressive. As with our other experiments, depending on the results, weÂll roll out similar tests to the other servers.

-------------------

8e65b082c4262407, do we have any numbers/data about how the previous system impacted toxicity in game? Is it measurably down? How is that measurement taken? etc.

-------------------

Interesting. How will the system tell the difference from feeders and legitimately bad play?

-------------------

So like if someone gets reported for feeding or someone goes 1-17 or someone goes 0-100-0 or someone goes 0-20-100?  Hm?

-------------------

YES, it's about time we cull the feeders

-------------------

Finally been waiting for this, how come you couldn't implement it sooner?

-------------------

This is exactly what GD has been asking for. I'm very interested to see how well this works, and am hopeful that this eventually leads to more systems to remove negative gameplay behaviors.

-------------------

RIP in peace Singed mains

Will it take care of the 0/17/1 feeder in my game the other day? Or just here forward. And will reports of intentional feeding help the system detect it?

It would probably be geared to detect and punish the obvious cases. Like, constantly running down middle into the tower, zeals, etc. 

I don't doubt that the system will probably miss some several intentional feeders that aren't completely obvious, for the sake of preventing the system from banning those that simply have played poorly multiple times.

a friend of mine does consistently bad (like 0 and 20) while trying his hardest, out of 10 games he'll end at 0 and 20 probably 5 times, how exactly will the system recognize when someone is actually purposefully feeding and not just.. feeding?  not that I really expected to be the first person who asks this but it seems pretty important

If you ever die 10 times in 1 game without getting a single assist you should get locked out of Ranked for a certain period of time because you obviously aren't consistently proficient enough at the game to be there. 

@8e65b082c4262407: you should look into this btw ^ I think people that repeatedly do bad in Ranked (below a certain average for their MMR) should be locked out of Ranked for a period of time or until they play enough Normal matches to return.

I dont like this. If I have a bad game (and I have had many) and go 1/8/2. I really hope I dont get banned for it. If I go 3/9/2 in the next game, that would put on me on the radar, then the next game, I would be even more worried I would get banned if I get beat in lane again. How would it separate Feeders from Getting beat in lane.

People don't realize this isn't going to jump immediately to the questionable bans, it'll probably start off pretty conservative (incredibly obvious cases like 30+ deaths) and get more aggressive until it reaches the point with an acceptable level of false positives (like 0.01% of the time).  It's how algorithms like these usually work, you don't just put it into high gear and hope it works perfectly. Have some faith people.

While that is the sensible thing to do, it is hard to believe the player development team will all of a sudden become competent given its track record. There is always hope I guess.

I have no faith in a computer being able to tell the difference between someone intentionally dying a lot and someone unintentionally dying a lot. I don't have confidence in MYSELF being able to tell that, especially with the amount of lag people have been having lately, much less a computer.

-------------------

I'd imagine this would be really hard to implement properly o.o  What's going to happen when people start getting a better idea of what gameplay patterns set off the system and then adjust the way they feed to make it less obvious? Like, just as one example, what if part of the check looks at what items they build and gets suspicious at Mobi boots + zeals, so the guy instead buys normal looking items but still feeds on purpose?

-------------------

Extreme intentional feeders......k like those literally don't exist, thank you for nothing. Keep on hammering on the players who get frustrated by all the toxic BEHAVIOR your worthless systems do nothing to address, because you are lazy and cheap and keep using some stupid automated algorythm instead of implemented a reply system so you can actually view the behavior and ban people from ever playing ranked again when they go afk farm the other side ofmap refusing to help thier teams.  but hey keep banning the people who get verbal because thier last 4 of 5 games had players behave like that, causing them losses as they try in earnest to rank up. Great work nice management really helping us all out bro! atleast you get to look cool smiting the poor kids after they get banned for suffering through the misery that is the rank match making you offer us.

I'm pretty sure you would be able to take some obvious intentional feeding games and easily say, "Yes, that person was intentionally feeding". 

If you have nothing but mobility boots and multiple zeals, revive, was constantly running up mid directly at the tower, and do this for multiple games. Can you really say that the person wasn't intentionally doing this?

Hey everyone, 

As some of you may have heard, the Tribunal is a system that addresses many types of player behaviors but is currently in extended maintenance while we upgrade a lot of the core functionality. You can read more about it here: 
http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/upgrading-tribunal

In the meantime, we've launched several test systems that have begun aggressively reducing negative player behaviors in League of Legends including a system with the ability to instantly escalate high severity behaviors such as excessive verbal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and worse to a 14-day or permanent ban. After several weeks of testing in North America, we are now ready to start these tests on the European servers. We'll continue to monitor the results of these tests as we prepare to roll them out in other regions. 

The reason I'm here today though, is because while these systems are effective at reducing 
negative verbal behaviors in League, we've been working on ways to address 
negative gameplay behaviors in League. 

Starting 8/26/2014 in North America, weÂll be rolling out a test system capable of immediately escalating extreme intentional feeders straight to a 14-day or permanent ban. Like our other punishment systems, weÂll start with conservative tests to minimize false positives, and then expand the system to be more aggressive. As with our other experiments, depending on the results, weÂll roll out similar tests to the other servers. 

Hey 8e65b082c4262407 I sent you an email regarding some concerns on my account, have you checked it out?

I have no faith in a computer being able to tell the difference between someone intentionally dying a lot and someone unintentionally dying a lot. I don't have confidence in MYSELF being able to tell that, especially with the amount of lag people have been having lately, much less a computer. 

It is probably easier for a computer to tell the difference. Think about how many times you click and the pattern that you do so when you are having a bad game compared to when you are trying to intentionally feed. Granted knowing the player development team, they will probably do something stupid and only look at kda or reports.

While that is the sensible thing to do, it is hard to believe the player development team will all of a sudden become competent given its track record. There is always hope I guess. 

oh i can assure you they will literally never catch any trolls with this system besides the VERY VERY rare idiot who truly goes on a full on intentional feed mode which happened like 1 in every 1000 matches. it is a stupid lazy system as per riots behavior team normal standards. 

you need replay with review to actually determine who is being a ****** bag, via the myriad of ways people pasively agressively troll thier teams, almost noone goes 0/35/0 intentional feed.

-------------------

I had a poppy end up being 0-11 or so by 13 minutes because of a ****ty 
invade > 2 man premade 3v1ing her top lane.In diamond 1. 
8a03fa754c611575 or something was the guys tag, ended the game being 
like 9-14-3. It was a legit game, but would something like this end up 
being detected?

-------------------

Will this ban players for playing in a ARAZ (All Random All Zeal) game in customs?

-------------------

How the hell is this not stickied...ffs lyte **** like this is important to the community.

-------------------

I got banned but I didn't even feed... search up ed8450809dbb7b8c on league you'll see I never fed,

-------------------

Now wait. If you ban the feeder instantly, could you make the game end in loss prevented for the team who has the feeder? That way it could be a bit fair, and it wouldn't be abuseable because you would get your account banned anyway.

-------------------

fix the god damn server.

why can we not focus on the WAY more frequent afkers

Thank you for your continued efforts 8e65b082c4262407. On behalf of the majority of us, your efforts are well received. I hope you can read this! <3

so what happens when you play proxy singed? Do I have to fear getting banned if I main it?

abbae0f1707eaca4: 

You don't even think you can tell the difference yourself? So do you just consider it an unaddressable issue then and want a total hands off approach from Riot? 

I'd say in EXTREME situations a person could tell, but outside of the absolute worst of the worst... no, I don't think a person could easily tell, and I have absolutely no faith in a computer telling. 

What I want them to do is, if they're going to punish for this, I want them to have a person who is more experienced than me investigating it. I don't want there to even be a 0.000001% chance of a false positive for this sort of thing. Nobody should ever EVER be banned for intentional feeding for having bad games, no matter how bad those games are. And while I don't necessarily think the % of false positives will be high... I do think there will be some because I don't think a computer can tell a person's intent.

So what's next?   ban/chat restriction for not playing meta?

-------------------

Will one game be enough, or does it need to be a pattern? I know I've had scores like 1/20/0 and was not doing so on purpose, just got owned that hard on a bad team. Rare? Sure, I think I've only put up numbers like that two or three times, but it does happen.

what about heterophobia?

-------------------

On behalf of everyone who tries to take ranked as a serious competition, I'd like to thank 8e65b082c4262407 for all of the 14 day bans that WEREN'T for sexism, racism, death threats, or homophobia. Your system of banning everyone who says something that might hurt a 5 year old's feelings is doing wonders for legitimizing league of legends and esports in general as legitimate competitions that should be taken seriously. It's even having ripple effects in real sports. Just last week Kobe Bryant was kicked off of the Lakers for extreme and consistent verbal harassment of teammates who weren't performing up to his expectations. Richard Sherman was given a 14 day suspension from the NFL for telling Michael Crabtree to "Get ****ed", and Johnny Manziel was given a 32 game chat restriction for putting up the money sign everytime he made a play, because it made his teammates uncomfortable and his opponents feel discouraged about their playing ability.

Are you comparing yourself to a pro level player? "They" get away with it because they are valuable, they make a lot of money for the people they work for. 

What happens when little league players trying acting like some of those hostile pros? Because unless you are playing LCS that is all LoL is for the rest of us, the pee wees.

-------------------

So High School and College sports don't exist? I've played for travel leagues in Junior High where people say **** like that all the time, because it's a competition and they take it seriously. The best thing about esports is that it's so open and everyone can compete. That's what drew me to LoL in the first place, being able to climb a ladder. If you're in diamond or challenger you're playing these pro players. So, if everyone who isn't a pro, shouldn't take the game seriously, then ranked shouldn't even exist. You probably don't understand a lot about sports, but it doesn't go, 3rd grade little league - MLB, there are steps in between.

And, you don't get away with tons on high school teams either. Singular outburst of emotion, sure. Constant insults and cursing, not a chance.

Interesting. How will the system tell the difference from feeders and legitimately bad play? 

We're taking into account a large number of different variables, which should properly distinguish between the two. Minimizing false positives is really important for a system like this, where the line between poor play and intentional feeding can be blurry.

Any competitive sport you play, the players hold each other accountable for their play. Sure, you could get kicked of for saying something completely unacceptable. But telling someone to stop playing like ****, or to not be a *****, or to knock that ****er on his ass, any of that stuff is completely acceptable.

-------------------

Oh, and every team sport, the players would constantly talk in "All Caps", because they're yelling at each other the entire time.

Like I said, singular emotional outbursts, sure those will be ignored. But if you are berating your team mates after very play? Are you serious, no decent coach is going to allow that because it destroys team cohesion. 

Plus there is the fact that sports teams are kind of like a family, where as you don't know the people you are teamed up with in soloq. But sure...

-------------------

I didn't say after every play, but if someone messes up, people are going to yell at them, and if your team gets completely destroyed, the captains are going to ream you all of next practice. And saying stuff like "get your **** together" or "stop playing like ****" in a just a few games here, can get you 14 day banned. Plus, any practice where the captains call out everyone else, and tell them how ****tily they've been playing, that could get you perma banned.

-------------------

You need to stop using the word "homophobia."  Nobody's scared of anybody. The alleged-offensive terms do not indicate fear. I'm tired of this stupid term.  I can dislike gay people and homosexual behavior (and I do) by simple moral conviction if I want. Hell, it might just be my choice because I get mad and want to dislike something. That doesn't mean I'm afraid of it.

Dude, one outbutst every few games will not get you banned. I know from experience.

-------------------

Oh i forgot, in football, soccer, baseball, basketball, they don't yell plays at each other, or scream so people can hear them or get them to understand what's needed. They meekly walk up to another player, tap them on the shoulder, say "excuse me sir, might i borrow a moment of your time?" and then after the offer of conversation is accepted, say "i think that we should, but only if it's quite alright with you of course, pass the ball over to the right side, nobody's guarding our forward."

-------------------

ive some games where ill feed 10-15deaths in 40-50minute games , does that make me an intentional feeder by the system even if iÂ´ve 8kills 10-11 supports?  be very careful with that system and only extend it to very obvious feeding such as 6 mobyboots or tears couppled with nigh 0 assists kills and farm.

-------------------

A few outbursts every game will, just like you have in real sports where you take the game seriously. You obviously are the kind of person who just plays for fun and doesn't care if you win or lose, so this conversation probably isn't for you anyway.

Finally been waiting for this, how come you couldn't implement it sooner? 

We've been working on several systems in parallel and depending on the various design and tech challenges, some features are easier to do than others. 

For intentional feeders, many players tend to confuse intentional feeding with just playing a poor game, so there's a lot of nuance to figuring out when an offense is actually intentional feeding and deserving of a punishment.

How will it be able to differentiate intentional poor play and regular poor play then? Not every feeder is (or will be) stupid enough to feed 103 kills to the enemy or blatantly brag about feeding the enemy team. So will this system only target unsubtle (and stupid) feeders or will this also hammer down on elo-boosted accounts that are consistently feeding against players way out of their league and possibly some player on a 
huge tilt spree?

Neither system relies just on reports. There are multiple checks in systems to minimize false positives, which is why there are very few players that get punishments when they do not deserve it.

it'll start out targetting blatant feeders (IE - running down mid with mobi boots over and over) 

easily defendable bans. 

If it goes further then that or not...welp we'll see. 
THey tend to err on side of Tribunal, and tribunal didnt' ban for intentional feeding very often since it mostly looks like a bad game even when someone goes and suicides 2-3 times in frustration

The bolded area is what worries me honestly. I foresee huge benefit of the doubt being such a large number of deaths that it really won't matter. Feeding 10 times can completely destroy the game for the rest of the team. There is no way to tell if it's intentional unless it's very obvious (50 deaths cmon ) or you are actually watching the replay of the game to see how every single player plays. 

Hell, a person could have no deaths for the first 40 minutes of the game then just straight run into the enemy on purpose 5 times and that's enough to ruin the game.

Well, I'll be keeping an eye out for those details once the tests are complete... I'll still refrain from playing ranked until then(partially because I want to know more and partially because of the nightly DDOS issues).

There are numerous situations that could lead to it... but you'd just rebuff them all with 'oh that's intentional feeding you suck' so what's the point in getting into this discussion. You have your mind set, there's no convincing you otherwise... so why waste my time?

-------------------

I can't recall the last time somebody on my team intentionally fed without announcing beforehand they were about to intentionally feed.   If the guy announces in champ select he's going to intentionally feed is there a way to punish them further than a permanent ban? Can you put a $50 fine into the ToS for this or something?

wrong, I have in fact gone 0/10 once. And I sure as heck was not intentionally feeding. 

Look, just because most ppl don't have more than 20 kills with both teams combined at higher lvls, doesn't mean everyone at lower ranks do. The lower rank you get, the far higher the combined kills per game are. Which means that it is a lot easier to go 0/8 and 1/10 and not actually intentionally feeding. It's called sucking. And we all suck from time to time. 

If I were to have a bad game like the one I had before and I get banned for it, I can assure you I will never play this game again. So I suppose your problems may be solved, but at what expense?

The think most people are worried about is that this will not solve any problems at all with feeders. Riot doesn't like actually doing anything but they sure do put on a good PR stunt. That's all this is. It's not designed to fix anything in game. It's here to placate people into thinking that Riot cares and is doing something when they really aren't.

So it can detect if someone is sitting there clicking the enemy Nexus running down mid and feeding? Sounds good to me.

I can dislike gay people and homosexual behavior (and I do) by simple moral conviction if I want. Hell, it might just be my choice because I get mad and want to dislike something. That doesn't mean I'm afraid of it. 

Saying that you're homophobic is a nice way of saying that you're a bigot, just fyi. Would you rather be called a homophobe or a bigot? Why have an irrational dislike of a certain group of people that has absolutely no effect on you in any way possible?

What if they aren't running down mid lane? What if they are going through the jungle and going over the wall? What if there are no inhibitor turrets? What about if there are no nexus turrets? What if there is one inhib down? 

See how this system won't know wtf is going on unless they set the number so damn high that it's completely obvious? That's why this system is going to fail. My previous example of somebody waiting 40 minutes and not dying then feeding 5 kills in a row would most likely get around the system even though they are breaking the rules of what the system is supposedly being designed to do. 

Also, it says extreme intentional feeders, so it will only look at the number of deaths per game and then do nothing to those that seem normal. Who knows what normal is? I think dying more than 10 times in a ranked match is feeding. What does Riot think it is? They won't tell us because it will be completely ludicrous and will do nothing to curb the problem.

Our #1 concern is separating intentional feeders from players just having a bad game. We have access to billions of games worth of data, and can easily see for every player, every champion, every role, what the variations in the data are.

What are the average game stats for an Ashe of your skill level? What is the worst game you've had so far on Ashe?

There are numerous situations that could lead to it... but you'd just rebuff them all with 'oh that's intentional feeding you suck' so what's the point in getting into this discussion. You have your mind set, there's no convincing you otherwise... so why waste my time? 

just like your mind is set to "its ok if i died 10 times" its a bad game. No its not okay to die ten times. with no assists or kills. Its very clear you havent learned and are not making an effort to stop dieing. Which is intentionally feeding. What really scares me is you say you often have scores of 0/10/0 over multiple games. If that doesn't scream feeding then i dont know what does

-------------------

Hey 8e65b082c4262407! You mentioned you are working out a system of determining what an intentional feeder is and what playing bad is.  The thing is sometimes they can be intertwined. A player starts playing poorly, then, out of frustration, silently walk into the enemy team. "I was just warding," they might say. The thing is it's really just a passive aggressive way to be angry at the team, and it hurts the team because gold that goes to them whether it was intentional or not hurts our team.  So what do you do with a player who does it consistently? Warn them to stop playing badly? I mean, I don't personally understand what it is to feed because I always want to win. But there are times when I want to slam my hands on my desk because if our teammate would have had a proper mindset and looked at the game instead of focusing on how poorly he's playing we could rally them for a win.  You know?

-------------------

The system will EASILY be able to find feeders.   It's as simple as detecting if you sold items at the end of the game to "hide" it (or not, I've seen plenty of Mobies/5Zeal match histories), and had an extended period of time without gaining significant experience.   People who click into the enemy fountain and feed multiple times are not welcome ever and no one but them would complain about them being banned.    And people shouldn't overreact. It's extreme cases of feeding. Having bad scores or even dying endlessly in lane isn't the problem here. Griefers are the problem.

-------------------

so, now with harsher policies against toxic players, is there any chance the Tier demotion inmunity is coming back?  since I got to Gold V there have been game after game with afk's, ragers and the like, (it has never been like this before, the streaks of bad games, it's so frustrating) and since the MMR is getting lower the problems aren't getting any better... so I now decided to stop playing ranked altogether in order to prevent demotion back to Silver.  yeah, the toxic people at division V are still there (at least in my expirience) and now I have the added stress and anxiety over getting demoted.  I don't even know how my MMR stands in right now, I have no way to tell how close or far I'm from getting demoted so It feels like trying to walk near a cliff while blindfolded.  so I'd rather play just once in a month to avoid inactivity decay.   it's a lose-lose situation.

8e65b082c4262407, there are people that go on a very long and consistent streak of terrible losses, what about those? Your system may determine intentional or not, but people that have multiple losses with bad scores, wouldnt that be easily mistaken for losing over and over on purpose? Your data from alot of matches give you examples of what a bad game actually looks like but I dont want to have to look like I have suspicious intentions due to multiple bad losses.

That's good to know. Cause some champions by design will typically die a lot more than others. Singed being a very prime example of that. Its not uncommon for me to win games as 2/13/4 345cs singed. Yet, what I contributed isn't always reflected in game stats alone

-------------------

Maybe if we just continue repeating "but muh bad games" long enough, the response will change! It's not like 8e65b082c4262407 & Co. have thought of that or anything, right? It's not like he has repeatedly (so very repeatedly) said that they'll account for that, right?

This happens a lot in D1 surprisingly, its pretty toxic which in turn makes every one sort of toxic cause changes of being with the same toxic player are much easier to occur since the player pool is much small.  I got put on the same team with the same toxic person 5 times in a row, now he wasn't toxic every game but thats because some of them went how he wanted them, as for the others. Lets just say he made it much harder to win while being a ****** throughout the game.   Alot of people in D1 are pretty conceded and think they are all that so they troll like a child of things don't go there way, and it really annoys me that these people are still playing.

-------------------

8e65b082c4262407, I just had a friend lose his series due to a member of his team "wanting to drop out of this division so i can carry someone", he spent the entire game following around his adc, stealing CS, refusing to play his lane and constantly helping the enemy team. With no tribunal system in place, and no chat logs, how is a player like this removed or punished? Honestly it's one of the worst things you can do to a team and it seems to be untraceable, even reporting him feels pointless. I just spectated the match and it made me sick.

You know? 

Some people have bad games and bad days, but that doesn't mean they deserve a ban for it. You will always find someone who loses hard early and kind of gives up. It also depends on what you think is consistently. 

I'm hoping that this system is being put in place to deal moreso with the people who will plummet their ranking by intentionally feeding every game. There are often reddit posts about these users, who usually have an entire match history full of 0/12/0 scores. I know a lot of higher ranked players do this with smurfs to stream their "Bronze to Diamond in 3 days" garbage. That kind of behavior is the one that needs to be discouraged. Meanwhile someone who maybe has a bad day and feeds like you described should not be permabanned, but if the behavior is repetitive (like one day a week or something) maybe dealt with on a lighter level like a temporary ban to get their behavior more in line.

8e65b082c4262407: 

Neither system relies just on reports. There are multiple checks in systems 

8e65b082c4262407 I want to believe there are alot of checks. 
But honestly... the way half the game is coded... 
its really hard to believe that. 
Sorry buddy. 
Its basically impossible to believe that. 

I'm pretty sure its "if you're somewhat toxic you'll be treated a somewhat banned player..if you're obnoxious you'll be treated as an obnoxious player forever... if you're a generally good spirited player you'll be treated as a generally good spirited player forever...".. this means that the system would be labeling a toxic player as perm toxic meaning it would never assume that he's going to improve at any point (even if he actually does slightly improve the system will never "check" for this improvement and call him and toxic and slap him with more bans even if he's trying to improve). 

I mean maybe if we had AI like dota after.. idk.. 5 years worth of time.. 
and good ai on other things that I can SEE with my own eyes in game then I'd believe we have some well coded program to punish players without even questioning it.. but we don't. 
SO I can't... 
GL with your banning stuff though, it's great what you're doing to fix up the community. 
But I still feel its the wrong way. 

This game's punishment system suffers from what I like to call "the carrot and the BIG stick" 
the stick is the punishment the carrot is the reward. 
You hardly ever reward anyone, leaving zero incentive to get anything positive out of an interaction with another player outside of a single won game (which is basically nothing compared to the 7k+ hours I've spent on this game and over 4k of these hours at least were spent with someone not being verbally toxic or suiciding into a turret.. far worse.. they were making mistakes willingly to lose a game because someone hurt their feelings.. or because they just felt the need to lose that game for another XXX reason.. you know the REAL toxic players... the ones you can't mute and ignore) 

But like i said, riot suffers from big stick little carrot. 
Nothing has been changed to say anything different about this terrible punishment system. 

they say it takes 10 good things to make up for a bad thing. 
Well the hardly ever see anyone saying how many good things they were doing and got XXX reward. 
Maybe its about time you start handing out free RP or something so people care about getting punished by a, so called, "toxic" community. 

oh and for the record... when its obvious to punish its obvious. 
I'm not supporting the mentally incapable of kindness players who use racial slurs. 
I'm supporting the players who make efforts to change and get nothing for their effort. 
Big carrot, little stick. 
Remember riot. 

There... Now i'm done talking about the bull**** that is bans in an online game @.@

I was, but if they are really comparing your average stats to those of your peers at the same lvl of play on the same champ to those of the game in question... it seems to me if the system is as good as all that false positives will be pretty rare.

-------------------

You can evade these punishments by typing "i'm just having a bad game" in chat. No matter how bad your score is, you won't be considered toxic by the system.

-------------------

The more of these "systems" that I see, the less I want to play. It's not because I'm severely toxic or anything, but it just feels wrong to have a game company trying to "Big Brother" you when you have enough stresses to deal with each match (bad teammates, rage in chat, your own play, d/c and server issues, etc).  Eventually it's just going to be a bunch of robots playing against each other.

When are you going to understand that Riot doesn't know how to fix anything. They know how to use bandaids and make things look pretty ( see new launcher etc ) but they don't actually FIX anything. 

They never have and they probably never will so get used to being disappointed. 8e65b082c4262407 and his team are the smartest dudes at Riot. They get paid to do absolutely nothing but look brilliant while doing it.

I don't get what they think they're doing here...they still haven't made replays a feature and they think they can have evidence for intentional feeding. I'm done with this company as long as these punishment people are in power in it.

In the meantime, we've launched several test systems that have begun aggressively reducing negative player behaviors in League of Legends including a system with the ability to instantly escalate high severity behaviors such as excessive verbal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and worse to a 14-day or permanent ban. 
After several weeks of testing in North America, we are now ready to start these tests on the European servers. We'll continue to monitor the results of these tests as we prepare to roll them out in other regions.

Lemme take a stab at some variables this system might weight against playing:  a bad game = rate at which these "bad games" happen; chat review, manual and semi-automatic (keyword search)  death rate = weighted comparison to other players in the game; if you're 0/5/0 at 10 minutes and everyone else is an average of ~1/1/1, the weight of consideration would be different for a ratio that is still 5x 40 minutes into a game when the average is ~7/7/14 and you're 1/35/6  items purchased = weighted in comparison to "useful" items, whatever that benchmark would be. Boots and 5 zeals, or 6 boots, or 30 ward builds would all stand out  proxy = rate at which the player wins; obviously a statistically different win rate compared to whatever their benchmark is means the 0/16/0 Singed/Trynd was assisting his teams in a way that KDA does not measure  I am sure they have more sophisticated metrics as well. Those are just what came to mind when I read through the first page of cynicism.

What are you scared of? You are either high enough lvl to never have to deal with him, or you are low enough that you don't have the right to cry about it. Either way, just piss off.

Someone that throws out random hashtags for no apparent reason? I'm not at all worried about your opinion of me.

Umm... I did have legit matches where I went 0/XX/0 and there was nothing I could do about it. It doesn't happen very often, but it DOES happen. (I thank the almighty Matchmaking system for that)  How would such cases be handeled then? Would I have to worry if I can't get one single kill or assist in a match? Would that be held against me if EVER a ban would occur due to that? How am I to defend myself if I'd get "rekt" in a single post referring to that specific match?  Like "Hey, I couldn't get kills because Matchmaking had 5 challenger smurf matched up against me, I did not intentionally feed even though my entire team reported me" ? I don't think that would work.

This is so dumb, all of the bronzies will be removed from league forever.

We've been working on several systems in parallel and depending on the various design and tech challenges, some features are easier to do than others. 

For intentional feeders, many players tend to confuse intentional feeding with just playing a poor game, so there's a lot of nuance to figuring out when an offense is actually intentional feeding and deserving of a punishment. 

Player A: Makes 3-4 mistakes and keeps dying to repeating. 
Player B/C/D: All recomend the same way to get past that 
Player A: Does the same thing 2-3 more times. 

Is this intentionally feeding? You know what you are doing will kill you( trial and error) you know of a better way to play( team helped him with this) player continues to die due to same mistake( a choice to die rather to live)???

If you read 8e65b082c4262407's posts, the system looks kind of tight. It compares your normal performance (including things like cs, actions taken per min, gold generation, ect...) on a given champ to that of others at your skill level and to the game in suspect. So, if you always play like ****, then that will come out in the wash. If you play like **** once in a while, you shouldn't be picked up by the new system.

So can you look up the account with summoner name 0159355461ce2a39 and post proof of why I received a 14 day ban? Thanks. 

I went ahead and checked you out. You are a good player but you seem to get into bad habits of feeding in the games you start to lose. Don't play every game the same... If you get a couple of early deaths just try to let someone else carry and catch up in farm. Play a safe game under tower or ask nicely for the jungler to help or the mid to roam. Great stats in the games where you get ahead, but if you're behind and you keep trying to fight you are just going to snowball your lane opponents. Hope this helps!

8e65b082c4262407, if this is a thing that actually works out, could it potentially be possible to increase viability in these systems by "warning" players about playing poorly in Ranked games?  Yes, we all understand that blah blah differences between not knowing how to play the game and actually intentionally feeding, but that doesn't change at all the fact that that 0/14/3 <insert champion name here> made that game much more close to impossible to win for 4 other people, who otherwise did not do anything deserving of such a hopeless fate.  Whether somebody ruins a game intentionally or not, they're still ruining the game, and while I agree that maybe they should not necessarily be punished for that ONE game, if they are found to be doing it consistently, I feel that it would be INCREDIBLY easy and reasonable to implement a "warn-and-restrict" system for these situations.  Ranked is a mode designed for people to play competitively, as in, at their best. If a person is NOT doing so, consistently, then it's entirely reasonable to expect them to be warned about it, and, if they disregard those warnings, I feel it is just as reasonable to want those players restricted (for some arbitrary amount of time, doesn't even necessarily have to be 2 weeks lol, could even be just a few hours, possibly scaling upwards depending on the frequency of these restrictions?) from playing there.

-------------------

have a system that detect what potentially is consider a feeder and have a riot review their replay system to verify if that individual is intentionally feeding.

-------------------

ITT  8e65b082c4262407 - We have BILLIONS of games of data to cross-reference, a multitude of in-game statistics to base analysis on, heat maps per player, etc. etc.  Forum Idiots - But I had a couple of bad games a couple weeks ago. Riot's sh*tty system is going to permaban me isn't it?!?!
