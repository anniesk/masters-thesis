# Master's thesis repository

This repository includes everything used in the making of my thesis "Machine Translation and Toxicity Detection in Finnish: A FinBERT Approach".

The data used is in directory "data" and includes the translated datasets as well as the new annotated dataset. 

The best model is available in [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/annieske/bert-base-finnish-cased-toxicity).
